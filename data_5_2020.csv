A badminton birdie is tossed gently upward;
it strokes its arc like a feather pen.
It inhales; it eclipses the sun;
and, full of air, it sinks again
returning home completely turned around
declaring it with a telluric thud.

But there will be no earthy court
to land on in this story,
for we have burned up on re-entry.
For we have scattered in black ashes
and the wind has swallowed up our sound.

And where was Abraham's great nation
on the day that he was set
to sacrifice his son?

And where are all our sequined galas
    stocked with wine we couldn't drink when we were younger?
and where are all the river sunsets
    by the Charles we postponed for late-night psets?
and where are all the signatures
    we'd scrawl in clubs and hacks and tech op-eds
    across our brutalist concrete halls?
and where are all the bittersweet
    reunions with out FPOPs,
    with the roommates we forgot
    and all the friends that we fell out with?
    
But faith, dear friend, the world is bare;
this Institute has breathed us up
and, full of air, beheld us,
and in its sickness prematurely
coughed us out.",

3/12/2020 0:00:00,"MIT as an institution don’t care two shits about the students and their well-being. I’ve been saying this for years but no one believed me :( Sure, there are individuals at MIT (like deans, head of house, GRAs etc.) who do care, but as an overall institution/corporate or w/e you wanna call it only care about covering their asses and not getting into legal trouble. 

Years ago during the “community conversation” about improving the process involved in going on and returning from leave, the MIT administration deliberately avoided answering important questions like “what do you do if it’s not possible or safe for students to return home?” Someone told his story saying that he had to couch surf for 2 months and couldn’t find a job while he was on leave and the response was “we expect students to have some transitional time”. Ok, so you’re gonna kick out students who are struggling with medical issues (physical or mental) because you see them as liability and don’t want a dead body on campus but refuse to help them find a place to live or provide some sort of financial help? MIT administration was soooooo proud that they changed “readmission” to “return”, claiming that “it’s not just a cosmetic change” but didn’t actually change anything involved in the convoluted readmission application like writing essays, getting recommendation letters from work places and all medical providers, providing transcripts of classes taken from other universities while on leave etc. 

Now all undergrad students are getting kicked off campus because of the coronavirus outbreak crisis. Sure, people can petition to stay, but how empathetic will MIT administration be? Letting students who would have to go back to their country/state with major coronavirus outbreak stay on campus is a given. But what about students who can’t/shouldn’t return because their home is unsafe for them like abusive or unsupportive household? I just read a confession by a student who doesn’t want to return because their family is transphobic, but MIT administration basically told them to agree to disagree about their gender and suck it up. What about students who can’t financially afford to go back because their only source of income to feed themselves is through UROPs or other on campus work? 

So what’s next MIT? ",

3/12/2020 0:00:00,"Today I said goodbye to my students. I turned off the lights and locked up my classroom for the last time until September. I walked on campus for the last time in at least 2 weeks as faculty and staff have been told to work from home for at least that long and maybe longer. I have many busy days ahead of me. Virtual meetings and discussions, as we work to make sure we continue MIT education for our students. But, I have to say today was a very sad day. Walking away from my passion, my true love, which is physics education.  And understanding that I wont be back, not in the normal way anyways for a very long time. I took some time today in my final moments on the now quite and mostly empty campus.  I collected my thoughts, and I realized that these kids have hope. These kids have drive. These kids are ready to tackle the new challenges that they face and I am ready to stand with them and take those challenges head on. I will support my students through this and they will come out stronger.  Today was not goodbye, today was see you later.",

3/13/2020 0:00:00,"Luis here, posting on this page to avoid being hypocritical and sending additional off-topic emails to dormspam that weren't actively contributing to the discussion. 

I just wanted to say that the email I sent earlier was a little bit hastily worded, and I regret not taking the time to choose my words more carefully, but I really wanted to get the word out that the bot was off and to apologize fast enough to let people know that I had already done the thing they were asking me to do. The reason that my email was so focused on the number of people I had asking me to take down the bot was due to to my main frustration, which I mistakenly neglected to mention due to thinking it would have been implicitly understandable: that the presence of the bot had attracted the attention of people who had the desire and capacity to do something about the current situation, but which distracted them from the main goal of forcing administration to adopt policy that would aid the people who are being endangered by the current housing policy in favor of chasing the removal of some email spam that had already been disabled. The reason for emailing from my personal kerberos was as a form of accountability, because I understand that people may be angry at me for what I had done earlier. I encourage anyone who wants to get off their grievances with me to do so, but to please do so after the housing situation has been resolved, as the people that need our help do not have the luxury of being able to wait for us to handle things like disputes over BCCing and dormspam. Please use that energy to go and ask department heads, deans, and other faculty members to pressure admin to be more accommodating to students who have expressed that they do no have a good place to go during this time of crisis. Nobody at MIT should have to be homeless, and making sure that admin agrees with that should be our #1 priority right now.",

3/14/2020 0:00:00,"Yes, these are really rough times for everyone, but this emergency pass/fail grading system seems objectively suboptimal. The clear best method is to have the emergency P/F be the standard, but also have an opt-in for regular grading.

Sure such a system might be stressful for people who feel “pressured to opt-in” when they are already dealing with other shit (as many posts have been saying). However, far more stress is put on the students who were depending on this semester’s grades to get into med school, grad school, or other career paths, and who now don’t have this chance. Especially if they are close to graduating, these students may have the course of their life shifted because they are losing a major chance to improve their grades this semester.

If you are having a rough time with the transition, know that we certainly don’t want you to have any extra stress. But for many of us, this is our last chance to improve enough to follow our dreams. An opt-in system is flexible enough to not hurt anyone very much (again, you still have the option to just not opt-in to regular grading if you need to) but the lack of an opt-in system could really harm some people’s lives. Overall, an opt-in system would clearly be the best way to reduce the total stress of the undergrad population. Please stand beside your classmates who really need this semester as their last chance to improve and help encourage admin to keep emergency grading be standard, but to also add an opt-in regular grading system.",

Almost all other colleges have been adopting more flexible policies involving optional pass/fail with almost unanimous support from students, while MIT's decision to mandate PNR has caused undue stress to many of us who have been repeatedly trying to voice this opinion (although sometimes not in the most sensitive ways, which I apologize for). Ultimately, an optional pass/no-record policy is the most optimal policy that reduces immense stress for the largest number of students. I urge everyone to consider signing this petition, whether you are directly affected by it or would like to show support for a more balanced, accommodating policy. Thank you.",

In particular, he expected many schools to follow MIT's lead (I don't think this is true) and expects that MIT's name-brand will make up for students not having grades when they apply for internships/grad school/etc next fall. If you think opt-in letter grades are important, please email the faculty officers with your reasons!

I think for the med school students, grad school students, etc. who are seriously worried about grades -- why not postpone your semester -- take a break and even help out with this pandemic in some other way by doing research on why it is so serious and why it is affecting all of us (not just the bio majors involved here)! If you can't understand the fact that you have PRIVILEGE, to be in a home where things are safe and the situation is calm and you can go day by day knowing you'll have a roof over your head and can take classes, please understand this... 
For the med school students, grad school students, etc. who don't care about grades (which I hope we all recognize right now is a f*cking social construct that depends heavily on your background, your situation, your previous education which might not be great but you somehow thrived through) and want to LEARN, then P/NR will be a great time to learn many things without stressing too much. And the way to evaluate your learning is to see how you can apply to your research whatever that may be (COVID19 or not).
And if your issue is that it will ""take you another semester or MORE TIME""-- well than all I can say is, it will take me a f*cking while to get used to the fact that I'm not in school, not with people who I consider my second home or community. And in the same way, TIME is what is the roadblock in biology, unfortunately -- and there has not been enough investment in that time and the future of biotech by administration and people who just think that you can throw money at something in order to get something accomplished. 
Finally, I'd just like to say that we are all human. We are all trying to get through this. Look at the world out there (or on the Internet from self-quarantine)-- we need to be together at this time, not against each other. And we need to adapt to the circumstances and help each other out where we can. Where there is need (like actual need like not having a roof over your head or being able to know you can be a safe member of your family, etc.)-- then we protest to the stupid administration up in DC.

3/17/2020 0:00:00,"Friendly reminder that a big part of the reason they instituted mandatory PNR was for the sake of the professors. Many professors may be trapped at home with young children, may be worrying about a loved one getting sick, or may be worried about themself getting sick. It's a lot easier on them to not have to make all the decisions about grades and just pass or fail everybody. I know that GPA is really important and affects our futures, but at the same time, the whole world is going through this meaning everybody we are ""competing"" against will also have worse grades or pass fail grades. I think mandatory PNR was the right decision even though I know it doesn't work for everyone. ",

3/17/2020 0:00:00,"Seeing how @281 targeted someone who shares my stance, I (who have been called ""selfish"" myself) want to share some of my perspective as well as to encourage people who are negatively affected by mandatory PE/NE to share how they plan to tackle this situation.

First, let me make a few points clear. 

1. Although I am an international student whose country is pretty much level 3 but not officially declared as a level 3 yet, I understand that having a safe home to return to is a privilege that not everyone in MIT undergrad community enjoys. 

2. I am aware that there are people who are ""literally trying to survive"" and I sympathize with them. This fact, however, does not invalidate the debate on mandatory PE/NE vs other possible (hopefully better) policies. 

3. I am not an expert in policy making but I am trying to figure out what policy can be better than the mandatory PE/NE. 

4. I used to hate the mandatory PE/NE, but I have come to accept it more after reading the admin's reasoning. Still, I think some changes can make it better. 

5. STOP. TARGETING. INDIVIDUALS. AND. DEBATE. ON. THE. POLICY. PERIOD. 

I believe in a simple concept: the optimal number of class a person should take on PE/NE is not necessarily every class he/she is taking. Even for someone who is ""literally trying to survive"", he/she might prefer to take one or two class(es) on regular grading while keeping the rest as PE/NE to offload some of their academic pressure. I don't think it is a valid assumption that everyone who struggles to find a living arrangement will prefer PE/NE on all classes. 

Possible solution: 

Allow student to opt-in AT MOST one class for regular grading? I think it sounds like a good compromise between mandatory vs optional PE/NE, is it not? (Cons: but it's hard for the professor to distinguish A/B/C anyways so this might not be very feasible)

I also find it ""selfish"" for people attacking optional PE/NE to *completely* disregard our concerns, which may include: 

1. People who are taking a header class that they really need an A on. For example, I am taking Structural Mechanics and Design, which is a header for structural engineering. In fact, in my home country where I will probably spend the rest of my life in, this class is generally split into two full-semester classes. I hope this is enough to show you how important this class is to me. (Imagine if this happened to 6.172 especially when you are already on track for an A in that class) 

Possible solution: 

- Do very well in this class and ask the professor for a recommendation to confirm that I have an A-level performance. (Cons: what about a very big class?) 

- MIT admin should allow student to keep their current progress on a class and re-take the second half of this class next semester / next year. (Cons: does that make your credit fall below 36 credits? / can you find a class to replace this class for the second half of this semester) 

^ please let me know if this is actually a viable option. I will definitely take it. 

- Take a graduate class that has similar content / builds on this class (Cons: a lot more burden on you / what if you are already taking a header level graduate class?) 

2. People who literally needs an A to graduate. Disclaimer: this anecdote is not mine, so it might not be 100% accurate. A friend of mine is a PhD candidate and he told me that he *needs* 4 A to graduate. He is on track to get 2 A this semester. Therefore, this PE/NE is hurting him rather than helping. 

Possible solution: 

- MIT admin revise the requirement for graduate students (?) 

3. People who are INTENTIONALLY taking easier class this semester to boost their GPA. (i.e. directly attacking ""also if you did shit all your past semesters, what makes you think this semester will be the magical 5.0 semester? get over yourselves."") 

Possible solution:

- I don't know. Help me figure it out. 

See? There are still concerns to be discuss on. Please don't invalidate our concerns simply because there is a bigger concern. I believe there is something that can be done to allow everyone to succeed together without putting more pressure on our friends who are struggling to figure out their living arrangements and such. 

PS. I am leaving out the fact that many people have been grinding their ass off for the past two months because I think we are all on the same boat. Of course I feel salty because it sucks, but it definitely sucks less than a f*cking pandemic so...",

3/17/2020 0:00:00,y'all out here using corona virus as an excuse not to shoot your shots. I say this is the best time to shoot your shot because if you score you get to take things slow and jump outside the physical intimacy trap where you wonder if this is just a short term 🔥. If you miss there is no awkwardness of seeing each other on campus and by the time you see each other again you're probably both chill about it. Shoot. Your. Shot!! ,
3/17/2020 0:00:00,hi guys! please consider signing this petition to add optional PNR grading: https://www.change.org/p/mit-office-of-the-president-adopt-optional-pe-ne-ie-grades-at-mit. thank you!,
3/17/2020 0:00:00,This whole social distancing thing is a lot harder when one of your best friends ghosts you,
3/17/2020 0:00:00,"Seriously, how privileged do you have to be to start a whole ass petition to make PE/NE/IE optional? Do people really not have other things to worry about?",
3/17/2020 0:00:00,Should we start a petition to keep the current PNR grading,
3/17/2020 0:00:00,"
As a first-gen / low-income student, I am particularly grateful that the Institute has considered the impact such an optional grading policy would have in exacerbating existing disparities in the student body. As a graduating senior, I had also been hoping to improve my GPA one-tenth of a point this semester, but it is clear to me that going forward, the usual evaluation of my performance will be nearly meaningless and deeply unfair. ​I feel hurt and disappointed that a vocal (but hopefully small) part of the community is blind to this. 

That you are confident that you can continue to put your best self forward now is a privilege, yes, but that doesn't even matter here. You will be able to ask your professors to write a one-sentence statement that your performance in the course was ""A-level"". I have friends who've done the same for classes originally taken on P/D/F and decided it was relevant for whatever application. Non-seniors, the number of classes you will complete and sheer statistics will tell you, I promise, that this semester is unlikely to affect your GPA. For those who had particularly bad single semesters to make up for - I really feel you here because this is me. Get those letters. Be honest. You're all smart as hell and anyone who deserves you will look past a single number. It isn't worth using (let's be honest) bullshit grades that will disproportionately favor certain students.",
3/17/2020 0:00:00,"Survey time: Should MIT students receive a partial reimbursement for tuition for the spring semester?

While students will draw from resources included in tuition, such as access to professors and teaching assistants, students have little to no access to other resources included in tuition, including libraries, medical resources, facilities and classrooms, tutoring (TSR^2) and other academic support services, WiFi (MIT Secure), Athena centers (Macs), etc.",

3/17/2020 0:00:00,"How dare some of you actually create and sign a petition to make PE/NE/IE optional.... You guys are actually so ignorant and callous like there are so many other things to be worrying about and yet you choose to sit on your behind and worry about grades? Like do you guys literally not care about anyone but yourselves??? It infuriates me to know that I go to school with such intelligent people only to realize that there is zero space for empathy in those big heads y'all carry around. If you need to boost your GPA, there will be many other semesters that don't include pandemics, evictions, and recessions for you to worry about getting straight A's. For seniors, many already have their acceptances to graduate schools and employment opportunities completed thus I am sure they can go without grades this semester. So instead of wasting so much energy into crying about being a loser nerd and wanting grades, consider using some of those extra IQ points you were blessed with to sympathize with your peers that are not a situation conducive to learning anymore or find themselves incapable of focusing on school due to the situation. There is no need to indirectly pressure people into grades or form avenues to judge others. Optional PNR just means that you didn't do well if they're on PNR, so everyone should be on the same playing field. Either way, regardless of your final grades in your MIT class you won't get far in life if you can't empathize, so good luck nerds :)",
3/17/2020 0:00:00,"Saying that everyone who wants opt-in is a grade-obsessed short-sighted asshole is presumptuous and hypocritical. Some people got fucked last semester and needed this semester for redemption. For some, that redemption was tied to classes enrolled in this semester, so unless they wanna drop and stay at mit another semester pnr has fucked them. Wanting to do better does not make you a bad person.
If you were taking any class this semester to showcase on your resume as material having been mastered, pnr means you need to convey that mastery in some other way. That being said, if theres a class with material you really want to be invested in, you should be able to find some way to work with that material outside of that which is required to get a good grade (i.e. do a project or some research or something you can talk about). If you were just gonna get a good grade and be done with the class anyway, a pass shouldnt hurt you that much. Just because you took 18.02 on pnr doesnt mean people assume you dont know 18.02, and just because you got an A in undergrad relativity doesnt mean people think you know your shit well enough to contribute to LIGO.
If youre looking for redemption, that can come next semester. Just postpone your motivation till then, or find somewhere to put it right now other than grades.",

I have been told over and over again that my expectation that friends will stick around is a kind of toxicity. That I am nobody's priority and I shouldn't be; that I have no right to anybody's time; that every friendship is an act of undeserved charity and so I must remember that my default state is to be alone and unsupported. And I don't disbelieve this.

And that's okay. And that has to be okay if I am going to move forward. If I really believe that friendship is sacred, then my job is to *be* the good and steadfast friend to other people, not to wait for other people to one to me. And it's never reciprocated, and that's the courage of it. I will suffer for that value. I will stand firm and I will expect nothing and I will give everything. But it's hard. And sometimes, in the midst of so many people talking about their gratitude for their abundance, I don't know what to do with the feeling that I am missing something.",

3/19/2020 0:00:00,"two things:

1) there was this really hot postdoc in my UROP lab. he wasn't always a postdoc, but he's one now. as i was an undergrad, i was a good deal younger than him. but since he did a postbac, he was actually even older than i originally anticipated. But hey, he's still fairly young and hot so I was undeterred. I was also 18, so eh. that's legal enough for me. 

I was and am a potato. this guy worked out a lot, so I was afraid that he would be like uhh this isn't worth title ix potentially knowing my location. but things turned out pretty great. i waited until he left the institvte to make a move, and he was pretty receptive. we had a great time. i learned a lot, more than i did during the entirety of my UROP. and as all great love stories end, i started taking project lab and fell in love with my Hot Project Lab Partner (the one that could actually use excel), while Hot Postdoc started growing cells or whatever it is that the cool kids do nowadays. 

So you might be wondering where I'm going with all this. 

As you all might know, faculty positions are/were being rolled out these recent weeks. Hot Postdoc is apparently going to be a faculty member at...the grad school I'm matriculating at this fall! 

2) I took 72 credits (project lab semester actually), got a 4.96 (b in a 3 credit class, please don't ask how or why), and my GPA went up a whopping...0.11 pts. So uhhh yeah. Not to rain on anyone's parade, but letter grades don't really make the difference that you think they do...best of luck tho to y'all, can't imagine applying during a cycle where everything's either cancelled or broken.",

Every time we collectively use a percentage or ratio to justify this as being some overhyped panic and much less of an issue than other things, our actions and attitudes will cause more infections and deaths that could have been completely avoided.

3/20/2020 0:00:00,"Here is a leaked transcript of a conversation between top Chinese government officials and the top executives at Zoom. The conversation, which was in Mandarin, was translated by a Chinese-American news outlet who have since been banned. Be careful before we decide on a platform to use!

(Z.E. =  Zoom Executive, C.O. = Chinese Official)

Z.E.1 - It was troublesome when that newspaper leaked the information on the Wuhan research center releasing the virus. Some right-wing propagandists found the article and started reporting on it. Good thing no one takes - who's that person, he has the brainpower of a wooden post...(a few seconds of silence)

Ah! Tucker Carlson - yeah, no one intelligent enough to take action listens to him seriously. But anyway, thank you so much for releasing the Coronavirus. As planned, we at Zoom will pay the $100 billion fee, as well as play those videos you sent us at 30 min intervals during calls.

C.O.1 - Of course. Did you by chance get to watch the videos? Are they convincing enough to the general public? We want to make sure that the Americans know the ""truth"" about this virus.

Z.E.2 - Definitely. The mainstream media currently is working on exposing Trump for who he really is, and this message will surely resonate with them. Any chance to take China's side against Trump will be able to give them content to continue staying afloat. What's even better is that right-wing news outlets will try to attack them, and some more wars will ensue. The public will start trusting your videos more and more as they get discussed more and more.

C.O.2 - Did you guys also implement the censor-filter that we asked you to implement? Because if not, we're not sure this deal will work. Remember, there is a whole market in China that we won't let you supply to unless these features are implemented with 100% accuracy.

Z.E.1 - Ah yes, our team is working on it. So far, we are able to change ""democracy"" to ""anarchy of the majority"", ""freedom"" to ""danger"", and any time a Chinese leader is described as negative, it is changed to ""Donald Trump"". It's very difficult to censor speech in real time, but thanks to your secret technology that can let us at Zoom read people's thoughts, we were able to do so.

C.O.1 - You better keep this technology top secret. Also, are Americans not suspicious of you making so much money? Is this how capitalistic and immoral your society has become?

Z.E.2 - Well, yes and no. Our society is very capitalistic and immoral, but our CEO, who is busy at the moment, decided to allow individuals to call more than the 40 min free that we normally provide, due to this outbreak. We plan to make the revenue we need through an ad program - so they aren't suspicious that we are still afloat. Once we have all of America using Zoom, there is no way that our true objective - to spy on everyone - will be stopped!

(Maniacal Laughter)

Fellow MIT-affiliated individuals, as you are self-isolating, please keep in mind that Zoom is spying on you and they also paid for this virus' release. I demand that MIT change the platform that they plan on hosting in-person classes with. Please sign my petition at

3/20/2020 0:00:00,"My grandmother passed away recently and I honestly just felt nothing. She raised me until I was nearly 10 years old when she and my grandfather returned to our country of origin. She fed me, clothed me, taught me multiplication and our native language (writing and speaking). She died after a long battle with stomach cancer but it feels like nothing happened.

Same thing happened when my grandpa on the other side of the family died many years ago.

And when I left MIT, I honestly didn't feel sad. I lost motivation to leave my room, but I didn't miss people nor did I worry about not being able to see them. The people I lived with for 3.5 years. People who I go to for deep advice, and who come to me for deep advice. People I've taken on shopping trips past midnight. People I pset with, eat with, play games with. I just felt...nothing.

I don't know what's wrong with me. It's not like I can't feel sad -- music makes me cry, my friends telling me they're sad or feeling worthless makes me sad. It's just like. Oh. People are gone. Sure. Whatever. Nothing has changed.

I wonder if it's because I'm most comfortable socializing online, when I can think through what to say, before people inevitably tell me to stop because in person I have no filter. Since I was stressed from in-person interaction, the transition to fully virtual interaction was smoother for me. But that doesn't explain my reaction to death.

This is what happens when you inccessantly undermine, underfund and see distrust in government agencies and instutions.

This is what happens when you actively dismiss and muzzle science and experts and put in places of power unqualified, unabashed loyalists.

This is what happens when 12.4% of your population is uninsured and 25.4% underinsured while medical costs are 2x that of other advanced countries (with worse outcomes).

This what happens when you're the only advanced country without guaranteed paid sick leave and actively destruct the societal safety net and worker rights at every level.

This is what happens when you spend 2.4 trillion dollars on unjustified wars and have a $934 billion dollar/year military budget. NIH, CDC and FDA are 54.16 billion/year combined.

This is what happens when you give a 1.2 trillion tax break to the top 20% in the middle and employ all your financial tools to inflate an already strong bull economy.

This is what happens when most of your population lives paycheck to paycheck while the top 10% have seen 69% of the wealth increase in the last 3 years.

This is what happens when you have a president who constantly tells blatant lies and denies reality while your party and media defends or endorses it.

This is what happens when you vote for a elect or party so that you can get lower taxes.

Imagine growing up hearing rhetoric like this all the time: all men are trash; all men are not good people; all men etc. As an adult, I understand where all of this is coming from. But I can't believe that, at a place like MIT, there are still some people who believe that, in order to uplift a group of people, you have to push down another. In addition, this is not only damaging to young men but also women in general.

When people say “not all men” (or not all [insert whatever oppressive class]) it pivots the conversation away from a productive one (and often makes a conversation that was about minority/oppressed class issues into one about protecting the oppressor’s feelings). Also people often have ingrained habits or ways of thinking that are racist/sexist/transphobic/etc. but we don’t realize they are those things. By saying “not all [insert oppressor]” it allows us to have an out to critically examining our behavior because we think we’re “”one of the good ones”” instead of saying “hey why does this group feel this way and what about my own behavior may contribute to that”. ,

3/23/2020 0:00:00,"Might I propose we make a separate page for Anonymous Opinions on Contentious Systemic Issues (including but not limited to: politics, discrimination, and the grading scheme)? I feel like an ""argument that is difficult to voice"" is not the same thing as a ""confession"". While I appreciate that some people might want anonymity in debates so that they can speak their mind without fear of losing their reputation, it feels like being dominated by debate suffocates the spirit of a confessions page. I feel that a confessions page, done right, is supposed to be about giving people a glimpse into the hidden personal lives of other people, rather than about convincing anyone of anything.

That's not to say that politics don't factor into personal experiences. But there is a difference between ""I have this opinion and feel frustrated as a result and here is my life experience of being frustrated"" and ""I have this opinion and you should too because of these reasons."" The latter is of course important -- public discourse is important -- but I feel like it is not the correct material for this space. (Example litmus test: if a stranger had been smart and motivated enough, and had similar values to you, could they have come up with the main content of this confession too? If so, it is an Anonymous Opinion on a Contentious Systemic Issue.)

And of course Confessions pages always flare up like this from time to time, but it feels like right now, when social media is serving as our primary community locus, it is especially important to have some loci that are not dominated by conflict, and having a space actually devoted to genuine emotional venting could be valuable.

3/23/2020 0:00:00,in the last five days i have spent 36 hours playing stardew valley,
3/23/2020 0:00:00,"honestly in my opinion, as a male i think men should stop having a problem with people of other genders saying ""fuck all men"". here's the thing, no one needs to stroke your ego and tell you that ""you're not included in that statement"" cuz if someone does, then you're part of the fucking problem. i think men should just sit down, shut up, and listen, really listen to what these marginalized groups are telling us (which is ironically not what i'm doing in this post xd). and instead feeling like we need to keep involving ourselves and fucking shit up, we should let these people enact change since we have already seen that they are really capable leaders (e.g. warren, harris, and other women leaders who are literally killing it around the country). now, i'm not saying men should do nothing, there's so much we need to work on ourselves but we need to take that responsibility to better ourselves into our own hands instead of being stuck in the same place because our pride is hurt by the truth of the matter which is that we're not doing good enough. 

but going back to the women (or other genders) saying ""fuck all men"" thing. look. there are so many problems that these groups of people face that men don't. you don't have to look far to see the struggles that women face for hygene products, reproductive rights, literally having their accomplishments mean nothing, not being represented, and so many others and men should get mad when they say statements like ""fuck all men""?? and in any case many of these people have male friends who they actually like and if you're doing such a good job at respecting and advocating for these marginalized group, then you shouldn't give a fuck about a little statement like ""fuck all men"". 

i think the same should be said about white people as well. i'm a guy of color. i doubt a white woman would EVER understand the problems i face everyday with the police as a young black guy. i doubt any white person would EVER understand the justice system that was created to put black people in jail and that if i'm ever charged with a crime, it's likely i don't get a fair sentencing.  or how black people can't live in certain areas STILL in the US. or that i'm the guy who gets pulled to the side by the tsa for extra security screening just cuz i have some tattoos. but time and time again, white people have said ""oh you're overreacting"" or ""i'm sure it's not that bad"". 

the point is, it's high time we stop trying to interject our own personal feelings into real problems and having our pride get hurt and fucking LISTEN and take responsbility to change ourselves. and i mean not just tomorrow or the day after. but forever.

If you don't want to deal with REAL LIFE, there are dating apps. There are arguments against them, but as far as I know it isn't to the extent that so many people AREN'T using them.

I'm pretty certain that finding a relationship doesn't take one try usually, but I don't want to go through the longer process of real life mainly because it feels awkward making friends with girls when it just turns out that I like them. My dad gave me the advice to make my intentions known early on, but surprise surprise *sarcasm*, that only alienated girls. It doesn't feel right to insert myself this way. Is this a good reason? What are reasons to use dating websites? Which ones do you recommend? 

Also, to men: I mean, sure there are jokes about how some of us are clowns when it comes to relationships or gender issues, and I get your sensitivity. I mean, it is after all a social norm, especially in certain ethnicities or culture, to have our parents (in many cases our fathers) or feel as if we were meant to hide our emotions. Many of us may not have gone through that, and to those that haven't, that's great. I personally know that I was influenced in such a way. I grew up in a hispanic household where be it in hispanic media, in one's family dynamic, or in your mom constantly telling to you to have a girlfriend or to not be so worried or to not feel depressed, to repress your feelings, you're affected in ways that you ultimately don't understand. But, the confessions issue is one of the issues that you shouldn't feel the need to spend hours defending (yes) defensively. 

I know my math coach wanted to defend me by saying that if I were sexist, I wouldn't come to her for advice about feeling jealous about this girl in math team from a school way better than mine. We were the only students that didn't come from elite high schools, though her high school was certainly elite despite not being labelled as such. I did have a rivalry with her, I was so close to winning first place in a competition in sophomore year, but I drowned in the last contest ... it frustrated me. It frustrated me even more how helpful she was in the team round for a state competition. I thought she was like me. I didn't understand why I felt so jealous. ""But, it was a girl?"" I thought. ""Is this the reason?"" I can go on with a happy resolution, but I envy my math coach. She said she never felt resentment ...",

Two great cruisers pass by one another

'til the driver of the weak one's taught, traumatically,
the only stable way to fare these oceans is to swim.

Yet there is courage in it. In the moment that his hair first osculates those waves
he sees in colors he has never seen before, he learns
the sea is made up of the same stuff that he is, he learns
his structures only ever were illusions, and
without his printed maps and radars that
Polaris hung above him the whole time.

This is not a story about being ready.
It is not a story about being at peace;
it is a story of the northern star unclouded,
of the sudden realization that
our journey's not what matters.

I am not ready, and I cannot be.
The world happens to the unready;
that is courage. Because it's not about
where I am at home, or what MIT has done for me.
It is not about growing out of MIT, or growing into it.
And that's because it's not about me.
Because it's not about the ship;
it is about the north; I was not ready for this water
but that has to be okay.
I have no rights, so I will not stand up for them.
But I have values, which I'll fight for --
the feeling of communion is a sacrament,
and empathy's a terminus pro se,
and I will throw myself in service of them always
until my dying breath,
so let the sun not rise and set,
so let northern star go dark and let
the ocean waves sink dry beneath my feet,
so let me never reach the Absolute and let me
fail at every corner -- 
the miracle is that the sacrament remains,
that north is ever north is ever north.

A tragedy, perhaps you say. But I am owed nothing,

She has known from the start that she speaks
from a position of privilege. Yet
blessed are the poor.

A tragedy, I say instead; that she breathes so freshly of that splintered wood;
she seeks with starry eyes turned outward, smiling,
certain transformation waits for her around the bend,
feet still firmly, blindly, on her deck,
deck still strewn with threads of broken ship ribs,
mind still planted distant from the water
that she said she ""cannot"" touch.
I hope that she finds courage but
the courage is down here.

So where was Abraham's great nation
on the day that he was set to sacrifice his son?
Not somewhere in the desert, no,
not even to the north;
the nation is the northwardbound,

Basically teaches you to recognize the underlying issues in a disagreement, the basic human needs that aren't being met (won't try to summarize the book more, I can't impart the same impact). It helps you quickly get to the root of the problem, and doesn't force you to compromise/solve it.

""Men are trash"", ""POC can't be racist"", etc. These are all, in comparison to what's going on in the world, relatively silly topics and have already been meme’d to death by the take merchants of Confessions. I think it’s likely a coping mechanism to find some semblance of control in an increasingly uncertain world. No one knows how this pandemic is going to pan out. It’s a complex and scary topic, so what do you do? Retreat back to the safer option of playing insipid language games - “What should the virus be called?”

We are MIT, and we can do better than indulge ourselves in this nonsense. Where is the discussion for the shortage of medical equipment? Can we 3D print it? Why can’t we build things in the US anymore? Why is FDA blocking innovation that can save lives? What is the way out of lockdowns? Can we test-and-trace like South Korea? Can we use encryption/differential privacy to securely track location data and warn everyone who’s at risk of exposure?  Can we normalize mask wearing in the US? 

I understand that this may be asking too much of this page. I know many of you may be at home with families that you haven’t seen eye-to-eye with for a while. And now you are stuck with them for indefinite amount of time. So instead of using this page as an escape - please use this time to connect with your family if you have a loving one. And if you don’t, go see if you can reconnect and make headway by talking to them. Finally, this is a stressful period for everyone including your friends and family. Take some responsibility, be an adult, and do your part.

P.S - I would support the admin's suggestion of moving the political content to elsewhere. Still would suggest to find less escape and engage more with family and friends directly. The coming months are going to be hard and we need each other. ",

So, they make rash decisions and don't pick up on social cues from women. Of course, not all men do this. However, this effect will only be exacerbated by continuing social isolation. Since all the men have been sent back to their childhood homes, they return to this authority, and the abuse that comes with it. As we know - power corrupts.

My junior year at XFair, I’m hyped, I feel like I finally have enough work experience to get an internship at a company (had done a UROP and a lab internship) and also enough academic coursework. I get in line behind a freshman who’s trying to sell that he’s actually a sophomore because he has sophomore standing and the recruiter is tiredly nodding, and I’m ready to make her day.
I go up to her and mentioned I noticed her company has an internship I’m interested in and she immediately launches into her elevator pitch about the position, taking a sheet with all the information and reading aloud to me. While she’s doing this, she keeps inching closer and closer to me and I keep backing up because personal spaaaaace. She DOESN’T stop and keeps inching closer and I think, “hmmm is this lady playing an intimidation game with me? Fine I’m going to stop backing up.”
I stand in place and within five seconds she BUMPS INTO ME, and FINALLY BACKS OFF but only a step.
But wait! IT GETS WORSE. She then asks to see my resume, which I hand to her, and then asks me to describe my previous work experience. So I launch into my elevator pitch of why I want to do what I want to do, and my skills, and she’s nodding while her hands holding my resume slowly slide up. And while I’m in the middle of talking, she BITES THE CORNER OF MY RESUME.
.
.
.
WTF
Luckily I’ve rehearsed my speech so many times I go on autopilot and finish selling myself while every conscious thought in my brain turns to WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE AND STOP TALKING TO THIS RECRUITER. I just blankly nod as she goes over next steps and WALK QUICKLY AWAY and then take shelter at a Kayak booth to talk to the recruiter who actually behaves NORMAL in an attempt to forget everything that had just happened but alas here I am retelling the story once more.
I have NO IDEA WHY she bit my resume. NO IDEA. Has never happened to me before or since. My resume is not scented, I didn’t leave crumbs on it, I still have no clue why she did that to this day.
The lesson here is rehearse what you’re going to say during a career fair so much that you can subconsciously say everything so when you have a really weird recruiter or you’re tired, you can just get it over with.
Note: I don’t remember the company’s name, I was that traumatized and I didn’t apply to that internship after that talk, so no digital records I could find. (I think they were a relatively small company in the West Coast?)",

3/25/2020 0:00:00,"To everyone who loves to reply to every confession to prove how “compassionate” and woke you are: how about you instead spend that time working on initiatives to actually help the communities you claim to care so much about??? Here’s just a few off the top of my head:

- Some people (including myself) are building a true-to-scale MIT campus on Minecraft. It still has a way to go, and any help would go a long way! Info is in the Busy Beavers discord.
- Speaking of Busy Beavers, try helping out with that! Really great idea that’s helping to keep the MIT community alive: https://busy-beavers.github.io/
- CovEd is a great initiative to provide tutoring/mentoring/educational resources to  K-12’s suffering from quarantines: http://www.coved.org/
- There’s a bunch of ongoing initiatives to 3D-print/sew PPE for hospitals that desperately need it: https://embed.kumu.io/fdc7cb12520a9773a04c734df749edac#fighting-covid-19?s=bm9kZS1vSUFNekpYOQ%3D%3D is just one of them.
- A lot of clubs/living groups are trying to organize virtual CPW events right now. Help organize one of these events!

Seriously, I’m so tired of scrolling through the SAME people commenting on everything acting so high-and-mighty, saying how they care so much for those less fortunate than them, yet I don’t actually see any of them taking any action (to the ~5% of commenters who this doesn’t apply to and who are spearheading a lot of these initiatives, you’re awesome, keep it up). 

What makes MIT great isn’t our debating skills (leave that to the Ivys!) - it’s our ability to DO amazing things. Mens & MANUS, not mens & mouth. So let’s all pick up the slack and show the world that we actually do care, beyond how many likes our comments get on Confessions.",

The thing is, while I hated every fucking second he was on screen, I softened up and cried at his death in the end.

Anyways, here's the food for thought I promised: to what extent (if at all) does a person's upbringing or cultural/social/life circumstances justify their behavior, actions or thoughts (or make them understandable and/or rational) when they are perceived by you as negative/undesired/socially unacceptable? Or when they are seen as positive? I mean, I guess it has to do with your disposition to empathize depending on the topic, along with a plethora of other things, but I'm curious about the ways in which - or the rhetoric under - which you draw the line.

More generally and a tad abstractly, what part of your identity, personality, skills, or _you_, would you consider yourself mainly responsible for? And what part of it/them do you think was/is out of your control to acquire and/or develop? Hit me with your hot takes, or cringe at the lack thereof.",

My grandmother died a few days ago and frankly, I felt nothing. She raised me when both of my parents were working, under nearly the end of elementary school when she left for our home country. She taught me so many basic concepts, fed me, watched me as I learned how to ride a bike and roller-skate. She was an integral part to who I am today.

I don't understand why I felt nothing. The same thing happened when my grandpa died many more years ago. The same thing happened when I had to leave MIT, when I had to leave a group of people I genuinely loved being with. Not even leaving my SO felt like anything...it felt like nothing happened. 

I'm honestly scared I'm a terrible person and I'm unable to feel pain or even become emotional from loss. I know I have the ability to feel sad -- when I learn that my friends are sad, I become sad too and I want to listen to them. I take them out on spontaneous trips and grab so much food at unhealthy hours to just be with them and make sure they just have someone. I even cry when listening to music. But it's like...death...loss...that stuff just doesn't affect me.

Honestly, during the last week of school, I was jealous of all of your abilities to...miss people. To cry and hug people. To feel like the world was ending and to truly feel like you were losing so much. I didn't feel that. I kept comforting my friends that everyone is struggling with these emotions and everyone is sad...but honestly it seems like everyone but me...why...why can't I feel like a normal person...?",

It may sound weird to say I don’t blame the person on the other side of the interaction, but it’s true. It also doesn’t mean I blame myself. And although these things can be totally complex, every time I go over it in my head there is always a simple way to fix it. Ask. Just ask her. Sure, you might feel stupid, but I don’t care. That is the worst excuse out of any. Just ask. Please.

3/28/2020 0:00:00,"While the group is discussing consent, I’d also like to bring up the topic of women coercing men into sex. This is more common than you think. I’m only 23 and it’s been a feature of both my major relationships and two of my friends with benefits. I wish it weren’t, but it’s ingrained in our popular culture that men are horny sex fiends who will fuck at any chance and that women are the ones who ultimately decide when sex will occur (this is crudely phrased and I appeal to anyone to explain it better, but this phenomenon is undeniably present in American culture).

If you’re the first person to tell a woman, “no,” to sex, that can be dangerous. Many women have this arrogance and entitlement that if they are ready to have sex, then it must occur because obviously no honest man would ever turn down sex. Certainly it could not be because of libido altering medication, being tired from a long day, or any other simple reason. If a man turns down sex, many women take great offense. It means maybe he’s cheating or maybe he doesn’t love her anymore. I have had women scream and shout at me, physically strike me, or attempt to emotionally manipulate me all because they’re horny and I’m not. Sex takes time, effort, attention, energy: all things you feel in short supply of. You try to explain calmly that you’ve been depressed and today it feels hard to get out of bed or that your medication is well known to decrease libido or you dare to try the excuse that we just had sex earlier today and you’re not feeling up to all the effort again so soon. Many women hate to be denied. They’ll break down crying in a manipulative fit of insecurity to shift the blame onto you, or they’ll storm off and ignore your pleas for forgiveness. They’ll hold a grudge. They use this situation as ammo in future arguments or to deny you in an attempt to get even. How dare you commit the crime of saying No. Eventually you learn that you cannot deny some women sex without starting a much larger conflict. Now every time you feel off or tired, you now have to weigh the costs of going through the motions of an exhausting ordeal you won’t enjoy or starting a fight. Now for every new woman you meet with romantic or sexual intent, you have to prepare for this outcome. You test the waters, probing to see their response to trying to assert your own boundaries. You try to judge their entitlement. You try to protect yourself from reliving this kind of situation again in the future. You can feel that your crude attempts to protect yourself are inhibiting your chances in already bleak dating scene. You feel like you can’t even bring up this topic with anyone because of the popular cultural stereotypes about the role men play during sex. You feel alone.

I’d like to hear from everyone how to approach this kind of situation. Both for defusing it in the moment and for picking up on early red flags. I’m particularly interested in hearing from men because there’s a lot of nuance here that you don’t hear much about from their perspective.

I know many, many women have had issues with men abusing consent. Much of what I’ve written could apply with the genders swapped. I don’t mean to employ what-about-ism or to distract from the other discussions of consent. I’d like to have this one in addition to those. I am looking for other men to speak up with their experiences with this often-ignored and isolating situation. Please refrain from trying to discredit or invalidate what I’ve said, because I unfortunately assure you that this is all true.",

3/28/2020 0:00:00,"i feel like i've slowly been drowning ever since i got to mit. maybe even since high school. i'm so worn out after classes, i can't do anything besides lie on my bed and scroll through social media. it takes literally all i have to go to class and get my psets turned in on time, and i don't have energy left over to work on my hobbies or go see my friends.

i honest to god don't know what the problem is. i'm physically healthy (according to my doctor) and i'm not depressed (or at least i don't think i am). something about having to focus on stuff that bores the hell out of me for hours in a row (in between zoning out), sitting through a day of draining lectures and tedious experiments in lab, straining myself to work on psets (alone, because i'm so ashamed of how slow i am), keeping all the formulas and procedures and deadlines in my poor overworked brain, all that is exhausting, and working so hard without seeing results in grades or recognition is so draining. i wish i could say it was just at mit, too, but i had the same problem in high school. at this point i'm just so tired.

it's even worse because no one i know seems to have the same struggles. my friends seem to have lives outside of work, they maintain some of their interests and their identity. i'm starting to feel like there's something wrong with me.

(it's also weird because sometimes i feel really restless - in the moment, everything feels like it's going too slowly, even though it seems contradictory to what i just said - so i get the feeling that i have some untapped reserves of energy somewhere. but why can't i use them?!)

it would be one thing if it was just trouble ""balancing"", but i feel like i can do literally nothing substantial and enjoyable outside of schoolwork. it's taking over my life and my personality. the saying goes that at mit, you can pick two from among grades, sleep, and social life, but at absolute best i can choose half of sleep (even though if i had the choice, i'd take grades and social life).

high school and college are supposed to be time when you redefine yourself, when you find new interests and form new relationships, but i feel like i haven't had the energy to change my identity at all, and i'm just the same person i was freshman year. i don't have the capacity for hard self-reflection right now, and so i'm stuck in activities i don't enjoy, in a major i can't stand, going nowhere fast. i want to find out who i am, but how can i do that when all my energy is going toward preventing myself from drowning?

I feel you. It’s the most confusing feeling when you know how bad you’ve felt because of the way someone has treated you but still can’t seem to blame them. I just wanted to add that consent isn’t just about asking. It’s about reading all of the social cues and making sure the other person is comfortable letting you know how they feel. It defeats the purpose of asking if everything else you’re doing is making it difficult for the other person to say no. I’ve been in multiple situations where I was obviously not in a state where I could give proper consent, but was asked so responsibility could be shed on the other end. Consent isn’t just a simple question you ask because it’s the socially acceptable thing to do, it’s about being a decent human and actually caring.",

I don’t know how this could work for FWB (never been in one), but I think something that has worked for me is just talking about it? Like “oh I feel like I’m not attractive to you anymore when you say that” and that leads to a productive conversation about the context. If he says “oh I’m tired, can we do it tomorrow?” and most times when he says that, we do have sex the next day or at least he tried to initiate, I think that really helps me establish that trust, like in general he’s interested. 
It really sucks when your partner deals with the rejection with emotional manipulation or a physical altercation, and thanks for highlighting that it happens.

3/29/2020 0:00:00,"This is a response to 983 where someone felt like they were drowning but couldn’t explain it. I wanted to comment on the post but I also love my privacy. However, I’ve dealt with a lot of what you’re feeling. The feeling of being burnt out, struggling to maintain anything and even the time thing you talked about where it feels like time is moving slowly. And this happened to me in high school too. I started reaching out to an older professor that I trusted and it kind of got the ball rolling and I was diagnosed with adhd. In high functioning individuals it can sometimes come out strongly in college. And it’s not always the stereotypical “full of energy bouncing off walls” type of thing. What you describe is something I struggled with personally for so long and it’s called executive dysfunction. I urge you to research it a little. Your post sounded like me. It sounded like what I struggled with and still do. But now I’m working towards my own goals and being aware of my adhd has really helped me. I don’t want this to come off as trying to diagnose you or anything but I just wanted to kind of give my story of how I feel and what helped me. It felt a bit ostracizing to me at first until I realized that I just function differently than most people. And adhd isn’t a bad thing, in a lot of ways it’s actually kind of helps me in my day to day life. But it’s also weird to look at people who don’t have it and wonder how they do what they do.

I'm a heterosexual guy, and I've had multiple relationships where there's an enormous amount of abuse from my partners because I didn't want to have sex with them when they wanted to  have sex. I had an ex (a current MIT student) who just had an incredibly high sex drive, and I was so afraid of her that I let her essentially rape me for over a year, because I thought it wasn't worth the hassle of trying to say no, and it took me too long to have the courage to break up with her. This shit is never talked about, and dude culture is so fucking toxic that I've heard ""bro wtf do you mean, you didn't want to have sex? why not?"" from the two guy friends I trusted enough to talk to about this. I found some solace in talking to a female friend about it, but she seemed to find my one ex to be incredibly strange and not the norm - but the same or similar scenarios have happened in my last three relationships/romantic encounters, and I'm honestly terrified by this pattern. I really don't think it's ""all women"" or ""all straight women"" or whatever, but in my experience, it's a lot of them and that's just fucking scary.",

i know it's not the end all be all and that it's still possible to get jobs/internships in the future when things get better. i'm just kinda lost now because i still want to be productive this summer, but my chances of securing another internship this late will be very low (though i know it's possible from my experience last year).

3/30/2020 0:00:00,"this is a response to #1015, from the burnt-out student who was diagnosed with adhd. i’m the op of 983, who complained about feeling like I was drowning. thank you for the response, it really resonated with me.

i’ve actually been starting to consider adhd, ever since i spilled my soul to one of the s3 deans recently and she suggested that i look into it. so i started reading about it and i honestly teared up a little bit because it explained so much, and because i felt understood for the first time in a while, even if only abstractly.

still, i’m very confused. how do i bring my concerns up with my family? (i feel like having some kind of disorder would make them ashamed of me.) how do i tell my friends? (will they think i’m making excuses for myself? will they start to think less of me?) i think many people who struggle with mental health in general can relate to this thought process, sadly, and i sympathize with anyone else who feels this way.

i’m the kind of person who needs to talk through my problems, but except for my therapist at mit medical (who i haven’t seen in months), i have no one to talk to. i’m too ashamed to bring up my struggles with anyone else, for example, the last thing i want to do is to burden a friend with my problems when they have their own. my heart is reaching out for a connection that my mind and body can’t make, and sometimes i feel like i’m going to burst with all the thoughts and feelings i have inside.

to the op of 1015, or to anyone else willing, i would love to talk. you can reach me at anonymous@anonadia.33mail.com . to anyone else, think you for reading. it makes me feel better to know that at least someone besides me sees my words and sympathizes with me. <3",

4/1/2020 0:00:00,"I’ve been here almost two years and I’ve felt incredibly lonely almost from day 1. I didn’t make any friends at CPW and for some reason was too busy studying and adjusting during orientation to make any significant connections. I did end up making friends, but it felt more like by chance than by any genuine connection. I joined a sorority, but even that didn’t help much, and from what my sisters said I got the impression that I was the last choice. I’ve never experienced anything other than warmth from them, but still, I wonder.

In general, I feel like I’ve been getting every indication that my friends don’t like me that much. I’m the one to initiate, I go and talk to them and go to their events and give them advice (and, now, set up Zoom calls), and they don’t initiate with me, even though they initiate with other friends. They never invite me to parties or even like tag me in any posts. I’m their last choice, and I know from experience that they don’t miss me when I’m gone.

I’m paralyzed by the fear that if I ask for anything from them, they’ll like me even less. They’ll take it as a final straw and shut off from me completely. I’ve made small demands on them before - asking for advice, venting a little - but I worry that that strained our bond, and I’m not sure how much more is okay to ask of them. Maybe I have this mindset because I didn’t have many friends in high school either, and so I got the impression that a friendship is something incredibly fragile and liable to tear at any moment. Trouble is, I have no idea how to make it stronger.

From my point of view, I’m a giant black hole of need. I need attention, I need connection, I need constant validation. I do as much as I can to shield other people from that, I worry that I’ve become the opposite. I’ve become so needless that I’ve become inhuman and unrelatable. I’ve been told that I need to be more vulnerable, that I need to share more of myself, which makes sense - I know my friends’ interests, their favorite TV shows, the names of their siblings, their favorite childhood memories, but I’m not sure if any of them know the same about me. But I’m not sure how much more vulnerable to be. Where’s the middle ground between undersharing and sharing too much? How can I build stronger relationships, or become more confident in the ones I have? I just don’t know. I just want friends who I love and who love me back.

4/2/2020 0:00:00,"Please don't be in a relationship if you're not mature enough for one. Depending on who you are and possibly your social experience, you're likely to already know. Simply be satisfied with yourselves and find your ""happy place"" with others. Trust me, those can be more satisfying. Physical warmth isn't what relationships are entirely about anyways, and they are made under the assumption that both parties know each other well enough to be in each other's comfort. After amity becomes a spiritual part of your being, then can one be involved in a relationship. Such can be found after college (it is not shameful, given the times and given that everyone has their unique needs/customs), and perhaps it is best not to disregard what the heart truly wants now. *Truly* wants. Be authentic as you can gauge the quality of life by how much you have loved, how fully you have lived, and how fully you have let go. Be ever inspired to become the most you can be after attaining proper respect in this mortal coil and universe. I refer to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, not wholly myself because I'm a very imperfect human that's needed much time to ponder these possible lies. In fact, in time, you will find true friends, and perhaps you already have: those that have begun by being willing to spend time with you to become close friends, and more importantly, those that have freely and continually insisted to develop a common bond. Remember that your happiness is not determined by, again, validation. Everyone's potential is different, and we all have different backgrounds, and therefore are different beings. We are varying hues of pastels that only use gray to highlight our dimensions and ponderous depths. The beauty of this is the greater numbers of youth that will contribute to humanity's efforts in infinite pursuits that in some ways benefit the world. To live in the past is to miss the future. And so too is to forever live in the present, as mortals do. But to wade in time is not to be idle. We carry temporal wills that drive us if we truly find ourselves at peace, not by fulfilling our desires, but by fulfilling our needs, and we develop our needs with the pretext of time but governed by our levels of conscientiousness. Down to earth, insecurities are what most of us share. We must understand that they derive from seeming imbalances in the world, perceived mistakes. But to ask of ourselves to fulfill expectations beyond our known limits is not a need, it is what may cause indolence and annoyance. What fulfills us is the harmony of the mind and spirit, veritably defined as happiness.",

My mental health was finally starting to recover after 3 years of involuntary self-torture, but this pandemic has brought back everything bad with a vengeance. And then there’s this ONE FUCKING CLASS where I have a really high chance of NRing, which would mean I might be put into forced academic leave because I’ll be CI-deficient. 

I don’t understand why some professors are just continuing like things are normal, keeping the same assignments and modifying the ones that are now no longer possible to make them even more work than they otherwise would have been. Like seriously how do you expect us to return from two weeks of no classes (and also what was supposed to be a time without classwork since everyone’s lives are in upheaval), and have a 15 page group assignment due Monday night (the first day something can be due??? There’s literally no way you can spin this as not trying to force us to do work over that break period), then another individual write-up due Thursday, then half of the final paper due Sunday??? And still have these long ass reports due every week regardless??????

I fucking needed those two weeks to recover. Hell, I need more than that to actually relearn how to fall asleep and not feel like I’m about to die at every single waking second. And instead, here I am feeling even worse because I literally cannot even bring myself to email my professor who is saying things like “our primary concern is for your health and well-being blah blah blah” while continuing to pile the work on, even when we were specifically supposed to have down-time to recover.

I’m so frustrated, annoyed, angered, saddened, deflated. I feel like all the hard work I’ve done to put myself into a better mental and academic situation is being undone. It’s a slap in the face to have a professor who I thought actually cared about his students continue to pile up the work and make it feel even more like an insurmountable obstacle, which could force me to spend an extra year here or even not graduate.

Just a thought, do you want to try initiating the conversation? Perhaps one of your friends is feeling the same the same way as you are. If everyone believes they have to be contacted first and don't reach out to anyone else, then everyone deadlocks, no one contacts anyone and then everyone is sad even though everyone wants to talk.

On the other hand, if you do reach out to other people, then they'd know you'd like to chat more with them. I don't think it's bad to tell people that you feel lonely - it's your honest feeling and hell, everyone is lonely right now. Most folks I've talked to over messenger were really happy to chat and told me they appreciated someone asking them how they were doing.

Give it a try, reply or no reply you would have done more than your part for the people you care about by reaching out to them. If it doesn't work out, I'm sure members of the confessions group would be happy to talk to you if you reached out to them! ",

I get way too excited over simple things, am not a great listener, get nervous when people get too close, get jealous when my friends find other friends, get jealous when people don't pay attention to me, get hurt when people don't respond my messages right away, and do lots of kind things because I want to make up for the fact that I can't express friendship through fancy and enjoyable conversation, because I get nervous. If you really see me, you'll see a person that cares too much about what people think and has struggled with that all life. My values are often skewed by the people around me, I feel embarrassed about my upbringing sometimes,  I am quite needy and dependent of men's opinions of me. I lead people on because it makes me feel better about myself, and it doesn't help that I love flirting. I have body image issues, I pick my nose (it's been a habit since I was about 9), I have hang-nails on my toes that look quite awful, and I am quick to judge others based on my previous life experiences.

But I’m an idiot and he said he’d be better about communication; he said he’d talk to me about how he feels, so I gave him a second chance after I’d already cried over losing him. I really wanted to change, to be kind above all, and I felt guilty, and I still forgot why I was mad at him whenever we were together. And so I gave him another chance, and things still weren’t the same. Something had gone sour, wine had turned to vinegar and everyone said I’d been too lenient. I told them I’d be patient, we’d take it slow this semester and rebuild what we had.

4/7/2020 0:00:00,time for some positivity tag someone who's helping you get through this <3,
4/7/2020 0:00:00,"Hi thought it would be good to add a positive confession here.
I have been forever alone my entire life. It got to the point where my entire life philosophy was built around the fact that there was something wrong with me. For whatever reason, despite not thinking i was especially unnattractive or antisocial, i wasnt accepted into friend groups, and (more painfully to me) i couldnt seem to interact with the opposite gender (ive always known i was straight). I reasoned that my purpose in life must be to bury myself in work and try to help the human race until solitary life becomes too unbearable.
My main motivation for choosing to come to MIT was actually because people seemed miserable here. I wanted a place where i could crush myself with work without being distracted and trying to join social groups that would never accept me. I was actually about to go to caltech because it seemed sadder, but then i visited here and everyone semed to talk about how much life sucked here.
Ironically, right when I got here by chance i ended up joining a very social community. This wasnt what i planned, but i figured i could give myself one last chance to succeed socially - if i couldnt do it here in four years that would be proof that something is wrong with me. 
I socialized a lot. Just by virtue of me living in my community, I was accepted into this social group. After a few months I had my first kiss - a pity kiss by someone in the community given for the sake of me having my first kiss. It took much longer for someone to kiss me out of affection, though i dont remember exactly when that first happened.
Generally, my love life stayed as shitty as it had always been. I started lifting freshman spring, and gained more muscle, but it made no noticable difference other than friends saying i was more muscular. Eventually, late in my sophomore fall, after more than a year of nonstop socializing, I lost my virginity. I wasnt attracted to the other person, and felt horrible about doing it afterwards, but it still destroyed my entire life philosophy and lifted a thick layer of depression off my shoulders. My love life was still shitty, and nothing changed after that, but that event was proof that it was at least possible for me to function as a human being. If it sounds like i assigned sex too much importance, its because i did, but that was the result of trying to rationalize the lack of connection i felt my whole life.
Nothing much happened for a while after that. I think i kissed one person once spring semester. Then that summer I decided to start paying attention to my clothing and style, and it actually made a big difference. If i could recommend anything to forever alone people, its pay closer attention to your style. Junior fall i recieved a ton more attention from the opposite gender, and while i wasnt good at capitalizing on that interest, my confidence went up and it made me start to believe it was only a matter of time before something real happened. I made out with a few people Junior fall and early spring, then the night they announced we had to move out next tuesday, i made a real connection. One could try to write it off as apocalypse sex or something, but we have been texting ever since. I never text anybody, but now i text this person every day. It sucks that i cant see them in person anymore, but still i could not feel more lucky. This is what i thought i was incapable of having for the majority of my life.

I guess moral of the story: it took me almost 3 years of constant socializing, 2 years of lifting, and a semester of focusing on my style, but i actually broke out of being forever alone.
Just wanted to give a success story for all u posting about how u never had cuddles and have always been forever alone: i was the same, and also used to post that kind of stuff. If i can do it, anythings possible :)",
4/7/2020 0:00:00,"Imagine living your whole life trying to impress and live up to the standards set by your older sister, and THEN feeling like you've at least met them only for your sister to not care.

In FACT, imagine having an older sister that you look up to that literally created the model for how you view the world/ treat others/ literally see yourself and basically function then not having this older sister talk to you.

To take it further, Imagine being yourself only to be reminded of your sister because you tried so hard to be palatable to your older sister that you in some sense became your older sister. 

This is not to say that I don't feel like me, or that I am the same as her. I am me, and we are very different people. But to do away with the outstanding number of similarities is foolish. My older sister has been so central to my development and its kinda weird to have that missing. My sister basically ghosted my whole family and only shows up for birthdays and or when she needs something OUT OF NOWHERE. I am not sure what my parents did to her or what we did, but whatever it was I am regretful that it happened. But I did nothing. My siblings did nothing. She can at least respond to their texts. It takes ten seconds to even fake that interest and make us a little happier.

Truth is, I do care about you. It pains me to see you suffer. I don't understand why I say mean things to you, why I call you useless, why I always seem to kiss up to whatever new flashy group of people I met in the past week to the detriment of you, my existing friend. I really don't know, and any reason I try to provide isn't going to be the full truth.

All I'm going to do is write down some of my emotions and thoughts. This is just a part of the truth, there's no way I can turn something as complex as this into a readable essay, and I'm no James Joyce.

A toxic combination of being bullied in childhood and familial teachings that emphasized distrusting others and never letting people get close to me turned me skeptical of the entire concept of friendship. Although in the past few years I've slowly started to accept that most of the time, people truly enjoy each others' company and truly want the best for their friends, it's still hard to undo years of this mindset. I still can't bring myself to attend most parties, because seeing so many happy people...it feels like a knife in my gut. A knife that says ""you know you'll never be this happy.""

I'm also a very clingy person. In high school I constantly nagged friends, dogged them with my woes, and filled them with the despair of my existence without asking if they were ready or even willing to listen. This likely was because, despite my overt and superficial desire to be separate from and to loathe people, I really did want friends. I wanted someone to care about me, but I didn't know how to go about earning these people. Earning their respect and trust.

Enough people have left me, have backstabbed me, or have had their relationships turn sour with me that it's filled me with fear. I'm afraid of losing people. But the way I react to it is different than most people. My fear makes me constantly imagine the brutal and sudden deaths of my friends, or their imminent betrayal or ghosting. Because I'm so certain that at the end, everyone I've interacted with will be drained until they're a shell of their previous vivacious self, I...try to force that ending out sooner.

I don't want the uncertainty of not knowing when my friends will start to hate me. I want to engineer that hatred. I want to engineering their loathing of me such that when they finally leave, I knew it was going to happen all along, and I'm feeling ok. Then I move onto my next victim. Or set of victims.

In this process, I've learned that most people are amazingly kind and caring. They're honestly wonderful people. It makes me feel worse. The nicer people are to me, the emptier I feel, because even if I'm nice to them back, all I can see is the end. The death, the betrayal, and leaving. Some part of me wants to save things before it's too late, but I don't act.

This is what goes on in my mind.",

4/8/2020 0:00:00,"being back at home had really made me feel insecure next to my younger sister. i feel like our first years of life have cemented our roles in the family as the quiet, nerdy loner (me) and the pretty social butterfly (her), and even though, in recent years, i've done everything i can to change my image, i can't escape our family's expectations.

when i got into mit, i almost decided not to go, because i didn't want to confirm my family's expectations of me. i also regret choosing the major i did, which is traditionally ""nerdy"" and has a reputation for being challenging, because it was just what my family thought i would choose. deep down, part of me doesn't want to succeed in my major because i don't want to conform to my family's nerdy image of me. (fortunately i'm a straight b student, so i don't think i'll have anything to worry about there :P)

anyway, back to why i envy my sister...
she's gorgeous, while i'm ugly and got the worst of both my parents (we have different parents) ...
she's super stylish, while all my clothes make me look lumpy and off-color...
i'm constantly worried about my weight and skip meals and hate myself for eating, while she looks amazing and eats whatever she wants and doesn't seem to have the same insecurities ...
i've had trouble making friends, while people love her wherever she goes...
we both love writing and art, but she's pursuing them seriously while i kinda left them behind in high school because i didn't think they'd help me get into college.

basically, she's the kind of person i want to be, but feel like i can't be. i envy how confident in herself she is. i know she might be faking some of it - hell, i do that too - but she genuinely does seem more confident in herself. i stopped doing ""nerdy"" stuff that i enjoyed, like reading and playing dungeons and dragons, but my sister continues to do that kind of thing and loves it, without worrying about what effect it will have on her image in the family or anything.

i really want to improve myself, both my confidence and my other characteristics. but it's really hard to change, and i feel like my family is always dragging me down. it's even worse now that i'm around them all the time. i'm so sick of being compared to my sister, and i just want to get away from my past.

4/8/2020 0:00:00,"I posted a bit ago that being stuck at home, weirdly enough, actually seemed to be beneficial for my mental health. I was actually exercising. Held a normal and even pleasant relationship with my parents. Had somewhat of a sleep schedule. Found myself doing things that made me feel happy, talked a little to people and missed them. A bit too much internet and netflix, not enough of hard reflection or any kind really. But it was a break, it was spring break after all, and I felt weightless. and I could see that feeling like drowning every day isn’t normal. 
Maybe drowning isn’t the right word for it. what it makes me think of is this: i used to do swim team when i was younger, and i absolutely hated swim team. Part of that was being an inept swimmer -- always relegated to the slowest lanes with little kids lapping me, plus the nastiness of public pools.
but the other part, the part that made it unbearable, was the exhaustion. the sense of struggle for every breath, of gasping for air for lap after lap -- nothing like the racing red heart and lungs after hard exercise on dry land, but a slow, constant blue smothering, carbon seeping in to my bloodstream. 
and maybe i’m just weak, right? my tolerance for difficulty far too low. exercise is supposed to tire you, and that’s the only way you can get stronger, when you’re putting in all your effort, giving all you can give. self sacrifice as the ultimate virtue and harbinger of self improvement. and look everyone else is going along just fine, kicking as hard as ever. [insert friend’s name]’s taking more units, working every day, applying to every internship… while there you are, floating languidly in the wake of bubbles. Trying to lift your face out of the water. 
i know, i know, i know that the reason why i am here, taking on the challenge, it’s because i want to be stronger. Better than i used to be, better than i am. 
but i quit swim team. and i'm not sure what i'm doing here, but it isn't getting better.

Thank you Bernie for all your hard work, thank you for fighting against the DNC, and I respect your reasons for dropping out. But now I feel so hopeless. I really have to vote between Trump and Biden... It’s so frustrating when having Bernie as a choice was so close. Having a progressive as a president felt like it was possible. Now I don’t know what to do. I know people might say the obvious choice is to vote Biden, but Biden is a shitty choice and not much better than Trump. I feel like I’m left with the same choice as Warren supporters back when she was still in; I can vote strategically for Biden or vote for who I actually want and vote Hawkins. I’m thinking about my reaction to my friends that voted Warren despite knowing she would lose, and I didn’t blame them for voting for who they truly wanted, but I don’t know if I could forgive myself if I did the same thing. Now my only hope is that Biden compromises his policies but at this point, I don’t have much hope. 2020 really has been the worst year.
Can I also mention a large part of why Biden is extremely unappealing to me is because of the rape allegations and his history of inappropriately touching women and girls? It’s so frustrating that I have to pick between two candidates that seem more and more similar in every aspect. I’m so sick of this.

the hours of the day just...pass so quickly. i hate how i still have to care about classes i never wanted to take, especially since MIT professors seem to HATE telling you how you're actually doing until final grades come out (aka I could get failed and not realize it until I NR a major requirement). it does make sense, i suppose, because otherwise i wouldn't be doing anything. (again, i'm not interested in 5/6 of the classes I'm taking right now, but am forced to do them because i need to graduate...yes, all of them; dropping classes is not an option right now.)

anyway, going back to people being bored during quarantine: i'm so confused. do you guys not have hobbies or internet? i get that news feeds only refresh only so frequently, but idk, i could spend every waking hour on the internet and still feel so excited that i forget to eat. and again, that's not including all the crafting shit and skills i want to learn. i don't exactly have the self discipline to be productive, but like...i don't get being bored. there's so many things to do.

4/8/2020 0:00:00,"Please read this if you use TikTok

TikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.

•        ⁠Phone hardware (cpu type, number of corse, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)
•        ⁠Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)
•        ⁠Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)
•        ⁠Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken
•        ⁠Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC
•        ⁠They set up a local proxy server on your device for ""transcoding media"", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication

The scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.

On top of all of the above, they weren't even using HTTPS for the longest time. They leaked users' email addresses in their HTTP REST API, as well as their secondary emails used for password resets. Don't forget about users' real names and birthdays, too. It was allllll publicly viewable a few months ago if you MITM'd the application.

They provide users with a taste of ""virality"" to entice them to stay on the platform. Your first TikTok post will likely garner quite a bit of likes, regardless of how good it is.. assuming you get past the initial moderation queue if thats still a thing. Most users end up chasing the dragon. Oh, there's also a ton of creepy old men who have direct access to children on the app, and I've personally seen (and reported) some really suspect stuff. 40-50 year old men getting 8-10 year old girls to do ""duets"" with them with sexually suggestive songs. Those videos are posted publicly. TikTok has direct messaging functionality.

Here's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing. They also made it so you cannot use the app at all if you block communication to their analytics host off at the DNS-level.

For what it's worth I've reversed the Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter apps. They don't collect anywhere near the same amount of data that TikTok does, and they sure as hell aren't outright trying to hide exactly whats being sent like TikTok is. It's like comparing a cup of water to the ocean - they just don't compare.

tl;dr; I'm a nerd who figures out how apps work for a job. Calling it an advertising platform is an understatement. TikTok is essentially malware that is targeting children. Don't use TikTok. Don't let your friends and family use it.",

4/9/2020 0:00:00,"the responses to the confession about how OP's parents are making them eat are really, really disappointing. i guess the final line about ""Psets > dinner"" is what triggered everyone, but honestly, it reads more like an exasperated joke than anything else. 

it's not unusual for parents to have preconceptions about how much their children actually eat, and to continue to enforce those preconceptions even when told repeatedly otherwise. 

There's a point where it's no longer ""I'm just doing my best to keep my child fed and healthy,"" and where it becomes ""If my kid doesn't eat exactly as I want them to, I'll harangue them until we fight, and then I'll hold it over their head, play victim, and emotionally abuse them until they eat all the food that I make them eat, after which I'll tell them they're getting fat and need to be more active/eat less/study less."" 

Or, some degree of ""If my child opts to finish an exam instead of coming down to dinner the second i ask them to, I'll beat them over the head with 'Why don't you love us??' or 'You'll understand the value of family when we're dead' or 'I can't believe college has brainwashed you like this'"", complete with hand-wringing and repeated shaming. 

i know it's hard to imagine that parents could take something meant to provide comfort (food) and warp it into a tool of manipulation when your parents are loving, and when home cooking brings you comfort, but unfortunately, it's not like that for anyone. please don't project your own parental relationship onto other people's complaints.

4/10/2020 0:00:00,Jenny is sooooo cute!,
4/10/2020 0:00:00,"""True artist and visionary"" is also how people described Roman Polanski and Harvey Weinstein. I'm not saying that what Neri Oxman did is the same as what they did, because it definitely isn't, it isn't even on the same level, but it's still /bad/, and you cannot ignore the bad just because there was also a lot of good. 

Neri used her position to compel a student under her power to do things they were morally not okay with. She didn't hold a gun to their head, or threaten to kick them out of the lab - but understanding the power dynamics here is so, so important. Neri Oxman is, in her field, widely respected. For a grad student, getting a position in her lab may be the culmination of their entire academic careers so far. Just because she isn't making threats (and she wouldn't ... for whatever else she has done, she is a kind person) doesn't mean they won't feel like their position isn't threatened: if Neri, whose time is valuable and limited, requests to talk to them one-on-one and asks them if they're 'okay' with it? After they've already expressed discomfort? ... As a grad student, at a critical and delicate point in establishing their future, how could they say no? Does this sound like a familiar setup to you? Hollywood isn't the only place with dangerous power dynamics.

And for people who protest that she may have felt similarly cornered, may I emphasize: Neri Oxman sits at the top of many dynamics. Not only is she well-respected and renowned in her field, as many MIT professors are, she leads an influential life. She travels to high-profile conferences across Europe, has museum exhibitions, and yes, was even featured on a Netflix show. Even people outside her field look up to her. And she had social power. She was in <Joi Ito's inner circle> at the Media Lab. If anybody could have and should have said ""No, I refuse to take money from this sex trafficker, sex offender, RAPIST"", it could have and should have been her. 

So now we must ask why she has managed to escape everything. I cannot speak for anybody else - and it does seem like there have been some minor inaccuracies in a previous post (it was just one gift, although I must also say that calling it a ""3D printed marble"" as some news sites were probably coached to do is understating the gift: it was the same type of sphere used for MIT's Disobedience Award, which makes it all the worse to me). But I do have personal experience in the lab. I no longer work there - I left for personal reasons, unrelated, some time ago, so this is not out of anger or retribution. Although I do fear anger and retribution. Maybe that makes me a hypocrite. But from my time there what I can say is that in addition to the points brought up earlier, in my post and by others - she is a woman, unlike Joi, and has access to power and money that Seth Lloyd does not - she is magnetic. She has a ""cult of personality"". People love Neri. When you love someone, it can be difficult to believe bad things about them. And it is so, so easy to defend them. But she did a very bad thing. She does not deserve to remain at MIT, beloved, in power in academia and in power over students. ",

4/10/2020 0:00:00,"It is troubling to me how quickly the whole ""Biden is a rapist"" thing has been parroted and spread as if it is fact. I guess it is kinda helpful because I know that anyone who says this hasn't actually done their research. There's a reason why not one mainstream media outlet hasn't picked this up, and it's not because it's all some big conspiracy (after all, mainstream media ran lots of stories on the earlier accusations of Biden being a weird touchy harass-y creep). It's because these rape allegations in particular aren't credible.

Biden is definitely a creepy old man who touches women much more than he should, and I'm not happy that he is the democratic candidate, but the Tara Reade allegations are not necessarily true. I'm a woman and a feminist, but the whole ""believe women"" thing doesn't mean you should believe every single thing that any person of the female gender says just because they are female. I'm not saying Tara Reade is lying for sure, but I think saying that Trump and Biden are equivalent because they are both rapists is some very dangerous rhetoric given the facts.

Read this for example: https://medium.com/@eddiekrassenstein/evidence-casts-doubt-on-tara-reades-sexual-assault-allegations-of-joe-biden-e4cb3ee38460. Or the Salon article or the Vox article (because I know medium is not the most trustworthy source in the world). And if you aren't swayed in any way, consider your sources of information. The only news sites with stories treating these allegations as certainly true are conservative or left-wing.

I'm voting in a replacement to Mike Pence. I'm voting in replacements to Mike Pompeo, Betsy Devos, Scott Pruitt, Gina Haspel, and the rest of the executive office who are arguably even more dangerous to the American way of life than Trump. 

I get that Biden is an extremely flawed candidate. But he is not worse than Trump. And CERTAINLY not worse than the fucked up morons with too much power and too few brain cells who set back progress on years of environmental, immigration, educational, foreign policy, urban development reform. ",

4/10/2020 0:00:00,"Since some recent confessions have triggered discussion:

It's entirely possible to focus on ""external factors"", on becoming the best version of yourself that you can be, and still be very vocal about systematic injustices. Being optimistic and ""hard-working"" (as if struggling people aren't hard-working) doesn't erase the fact that you got the short end of the stick multiple times, and have to live with that. 

Let people vent, and let people speak about their experiences without painting them as self-pitying wastes of space. You don't know them, and you don't know what they've done to surmount their difficulties. If you met these people in real life, without knowing any of their backstory, you probably wouldn't even suspect that they came from disadvantaged backgrounds. 

""The world is unfair"": it's astonishing how often that phrase gets misused. The world is unfair, in that some people will win lotteries and you won't, or that some people will randomly drop a bottle of wine and catch the eye of a billionaire. In essence, there are things that are out of anyone's control.

But drastic class inequality, racial violence, so on and so forth--those *are* within human control. It's unfair to be born to abusive and controlling parents, yes. But society can do things to help the victims in those situation, or to take them away from those circumstances. Same goes for equity in education, etc etc. You can't really extol the wonders of the ""American Dream"" or ""human rights"" while ignoring all of society's problems and telling people to blame themselves and ""work harder"". 

If we let the arbitrary unfairness of life justifies everything bad that happens to us, what's the point of trying to make the world a better place? Why not let life just be a free for all, then? Many of you rely on support networks that you don't realize exist because you take them for granted; I'm sure you'd all fare great if you had to grow up without them.

4/11/2020 0:00:00,"For all the people who say they won’t vote for Biden: 1. How can you believe that Bernie was a good candidate when he failed to gather the support of a large portion of minorities? Doesn’t that signify something? 2. The electoral college is a thing and it is super important that people in swing states go out to vote for Biden. How many swing states did Bernie win? If he can’t win a swing state in the primary how can he be expected to win in the general election. 3. Saying that you won’t vote for Biden (if you are eligible to vote) is a reflection of how privileged you are. Regardless of whether you think Bernie vs Biden would be better, there is no doubt that Biden would be better than trump. Many people have been marginalized by Trump, many who can’t even vote. You should think of others, like the children in cages and the thousands who are dying from Covid-19 because of the lack of Trump’s response
before you decide not to vote for Biden. ",
4/11/2020 0:00:00,"I understand that its peoples prerogative to vote for candidates they believe in but I think at this point we have to set those things aside a little (its unfortunate but so many things arent functioning in our democracy right now). I think that we need to focus on trump not being in office for the next four years. We have seen the damage he has done and we are the ones who would have to live with the consequences. Im not happy with Biden really but at the same time his policies are more in the right direction than other alternatives. We had an issue with voter turnout and I think this will happen again if we lose sight of the goal of kicking Trump out.

I personally feel we have outgrown the two party system but we still have it now and the two parties will still dominate this cycle. It sucks but I think that at least having Biden will mean no trump which will mean less things getting majorly fucked up. Transitioning to another system where the green party and other completely valid voices are present is what I would want and while that will only happen when we try to prop up and vote for third parties, I dont think this is the election to do it since the consequence is Trump. I think the only way we can move in that direction is to get Trump out of office and I do think that should take precedent a little bit in this election because there is a lot more at stake with Trump winning than if Biden does. 

Maybe I'm missing something and I genuinely want to understand if you disagree but to me voting third party this election has very little benefit compared to the potential harm of another four year trump presidency.

4/11/2020 0:00:00,"Okay, here's the thing. I will be voting for Biden in the 2020 election. I will be voting for him not because of ""blue no matter who,"" but because I agree with more of his policies than Donald Trump's. That's what it comes down to, at least for me. However, a vote is owed. Telling people that they have to vote for Biden or else they are ""voting for Trump"" is not only false, but it's not an effective way to win an election. I know cause it's all we did in 2020. I am voting for Joe Biden and I will be campaigning with him starting this Tuesday when I'm going to a online youth organizing meeting. My job, our job, is to try to convince voters. Explain his policies and what he would do and how dramatically different that would be than what Donald Trump would do. But no one is required to vote for any specific candidate. Part of being in a democracy is you can chose to not vote. Not voting, or voting 3rd party is a legitimate way to say you don't care. That the two candidates are the same and it doesn't which one wins. If you want to Joe Biden to win, our job is to convince people that it is not the case that the two candidates are the same. I want to convince people that January 2021 can look significantly different with Biden in office, but that's on the campaign and all of us.

Online deadlines feel so much less real/immediate, so I don't even get that usual last-second motivation rush that I rely on or other people being productive around me.

All my progressive friends stan him, and it feels really weird that I'm uncomfortable talking with them about politics this election cycle.

If you're a sexual assault survivor and you literally can't bring yourself to vote for him, i understand. But if you're just voting third party, or not voting at all, because you think that biden is ""just as bad as trump"", you either haven't done literally any research in biden's policies, or you don't care about the rights of afab people, lgbt people, people of color, immigrants, and any of the countless groups of people being maliciously oppressed by trump's administration.

4/11/2020 0:00:00,"So, I think this will help make arguments a little bit more concise, or at least more meaningfully directed.

Can the Bernie-but-not-Biden supporters lay out their reasoning for not voting Biden, and the same for Bernie-but-now-Biden supporters, in a Premise-Premise-Conclusion format (if you’re swinging Bernie to Trump, then that works as well). As an example, this seems to be the most common argument I see:

P1) Biden is a very unethical candidate for some reason(s) (rape accusations, stance on Iraq War, etc.)

P2) I will not, by my own personal standards/ethics, vote for a candidate who is very unethical.

C) I will not vote for Biden.


I think this is not only a useful exercise for discussion between people with differing opinions, but also a good one to lay out, for yourself, the reasons you support someone. Maybe you really are a one- to two-issue voter, and you didn’t internally know it, or maybe you care a lot about personality. This can make that clear. ",

They closed the gyms in dorms and the sidewalks are too narrow to social distance when you inevitably pass people. It seems unnecessary to kick people off the field when it’s plenty large for the 10 or so people using it at a time to be well over 50 feet apart and doing their own exercise.

We were forced to marry in a mosque instead, as required by the newly implemented Sharia Law. Since we couldn't have children of our own, we decided to adopt. However, no children were available since Obama's CDC required Planned Parenthood to perform mandatory abortions. At least we had the money and property we earned though. Or so we thought; our tax rate was increased to 118%, requiring us to take second and even third jobs to pay the IRS. It turns out that our tax money was being given to the Mexican pot dealer next door, since he complained about having to work.

I don’t call myself a republican because I disagree with a lot of their beliefs and don’t associate myself with them. I don’t feel a need to hide my conservative beliefs because they are not to be ashamed of. There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with being conservative in some aspects because people have different ideas about what’s the best for society, and social problems are nuanced enough to not have a single correct answer.

4/12/2020 0:00:00,"Maybe unpopular opinion, we should have some kind of test to qualify people for voting. Here's why I think so:

1. We already have tests and regulations to ensure people do things safely even if they are considered rights or otherwise important (think gun safety in some places, or needing a license to drive which is basically necessary to hold a job in many parts of the country). Knowing how the political system works is important to vote properly.

2. We already make immigrants go through an exam to become citizens and vote. I actually took this test myself to become a citizen. The test is not politically biased and basically just makes sure people know how the country works at a high level before being allowed to participate. We literally can use the exact same tests which already exist.

3. We can just administer these tests in schools (maybe also teach civics if possible) making access way less of an issue. 

4. I'd been taught that voting tests are racist. I only recently learned how this was the case -- it wasn't anything subtle, literally just that only people whose grandparents couldn't vote (i.e. black people and immigrants) had to take the test. It seems clear to me that the test itself wasn't the issue but this blatant loophole in the process.

5. We are increasingly seeing parts of the US government's system ignored and abused, such as a lack of proper separation of powers between the branches of government. Knowing how such things work in theory would help voters make better decisions about whether an elected official is acting in line with the constitution and the spirit of American democracy.

You political folks stigmatize us so much for not voting, when you don't realize that a refusal to vote is still a stand, against the entire system.  Stop trying to guilt trip us and insult us with your absurd definition of ""privilege"" to get us to vote for a suboptimal candidate.

Ever wonder why US turnout is so low? Our elections barely even hit 50% turnout (among registered voters), which is, in many countries, low enough that the election results would be illegitimate. Many of us choose not to vote not because we're lazy or politically uneducated or for moral reasons, but rather because we don't find ANY of the candidates suitable for government. We don't trust the government enough to give a vote - voting for anyone running is a vote for this current broken system; a vote for no one is the only one against it.

Voting gives our political system the veil of democracy, which has already ceased to exist.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.amp.html

Now my biased opinion: Don’t compare this to the accusations against Trump, don’t compare this to those against Kavanaugh. They’re are not even close. 

1. Ms Reade didn’t even name Biden in the police report
2. She says she filed a complaint but she hasn’t provided a copy of it, and the complaint hasn’t been found
3. “As it has for thousands of people who have contacted the group, the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which does not represent clients, gave her a list of lawyers with expertise in such cases. She said she contacted every single one but none took her case.”
4. “ The Times interviewed Ms. Reade on multiple days over hours, as well as those she told about Mr. Biden’s behavior and other friends. The Times has also interviewed lawyers who spoke to Ms. Reade about her allegation; nearly two dozen people who worked with Mr. Biden during the early 1990s, including many who worked with Ms. Reade; and the other seven women who criticized Mr. Biden last year, to discuss their experiences with him. No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden”

To end this long post: when it comes to the treatment of women and attitudes towards women’s issues, Biden and Trump are very far apart, and if you are a liberal who can’t bring themself to vote for Biden WHEN it’s a choice between him and Trump, that’s ok, but know that you are passively enabling the election of someone who is morally reprehensible AND incompetent AND likely antithetical to ALL your views, not just a couple.",

He said they’ve committed almost $50 million to helping students get home, technology transitions, paying staff through May, etc. But compared to the $16-17 billion endowment MIT gets annually? Almost nothing. Especially when you consider all the things MIT isn’t spending while everyone is gone. 

And to act like you’re helping so much by donating 20% of your $1.19 million salary? You could be delegating so much more from MIT to support the Staff Emergency Hardship Fund.

4/14/2020 0:00:00,"i feel like i truly don't belong in my major and i'm seriously considering switching out. i feel like i can't talk to anyone irl about this, and so i just want to tell the full story.
for context, i'm a course 8. some of my problems...
- i struggled with 8.02 (even though i had ap physics in hs), but most of my 8 classmates seemed to think those were easy classes. 8.033 and 8.03 were even worse, 8.112 made iap a nightmare (the catapult was cool tho), and now i'm struggling through 8.04 and i have no idea what's going on.
- i haven't made any friends in course 8. i'm in the class group chats and i chat with the people in my class, but we're not friends. i do go to the pcr, but i'm too shy to talk to anyone there. i'm not an ""introvert"", i like people in general and i have plenty of friends from other courses, but when it comes to course 8 i guess i have a huge inferiority complex. last time i worked with a big group of classmates, i contributed literally nothing, was like 3 problems behind and was always asking everyone what was going on. my mind just works slower than everyone else's i think, it takes me much longer to read the problems and work through the psets and to even understand what's going on in the first place.
- i feel like i've ruined my relationship with my advisor - every time i go see him for advice, i end up breaking down and crying, and he says he's not willing to write me a recommendation because he doesn't know anything about my life and my achievements ... like i have any!
- i don't have relationships with any other faculty members, i have no idea what it would take other than ""going to office hours"" and honestly during office hours i'm too busy trying to finish the pset to build relationships or w/e. also i'm not a spectacular or memorable student by any means.
- i'm a solid b student when i work my ass off. and ""working my ass off"" means straining my relationships with friends, worsening my mental health, having literally no energy for hobbies or anything i actually enjoy. last semester was funnnnn
- i tried to get a physics urop but the one person that got back to me was offering what seemed like the most boring urop on the planet for me, basically writing code to analyse data. is this what real-world physics is like?! happily i did get a urop in a different department (but after having to convince a bunch of bio grad students that being course 8 didn't stop me from wanting a bio urop)
- i don't feel like i have a future. i don't think i'm cut out for grad school (...if undergrad is this hard, and if i don't like physics enough). but i hate the thought of coding or consulting or whatever else a course 8 would realistically do all day.
""why did you choose course 8 in the first place?"" i honestly don't know, after all the classes and the struggles i don't remember. i think i had an idealised image of physics in my mind that turned out not to be reality. but i'm not sure if another course would be any better.
(btw i'm already seeing someone at mit mental health, i'm not depressed, it's been suggested that i have undiagnosed adhd tho which might be exacerbating my problems)

I guess, if I have to have a confession, it's that I checked google maps to see if I was suddenly transported to North Korea.  I'm not.  I'm still in the US.  And I'm sickened and terrified for our country.

I watched the white house task force briefing.  Here's the link. Skip to 14:30 if you want to know what I'm talking about.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSrD3MAjcA8&feature=youtu.be.  Description/reaction below, but watch the video first if you want the full effect.  You might not.  It was an unpleasant experience.

The entire clip is Trump patting himself on the back for doing such a good job in response to the coronavirus pandemic.  It starts with him blaming the media for downplaying the potential effects of the virus and juxtaposing that with his own swift response.  No surprise.  Blaming the media is just par for the course nowadays.  Some media outlets probably did downplay the virus, but many didn't.  That's what's great about a free press.  You can see all the sides to an issue.  But, the effect of this video is that they ALL downplayed it, while he came in and played savior.  That's not what happened.

In the timeline that scrolls by, you can see that the first covid case is reported in the US, THEN and only then does he cancel flights to china.  And eventually Europe.  But it's a bit too late. But the video, this OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE video, just ignores any mistakes and treats what was done as the ideal.  It wasn't.  I've lived through this.  We've all lived through this.  And this video is just so misleading, and frankly upsetting.

It gets worse.  He makes it a partisan issue, calling out people who criticized him, out of context, might I add.  This part gets a little messy, and frankly I haven't read enough about it to make a judgment.  I'm not going to get into whether or not he was racist for halting flights to china.  I'm not going to get into whether it was the right move or the right time or the right circumstances to do it.  I'm not going to talk about if the criticisms were justified.  I AM going to point out that the virus was already here.  And in Europe.  It was too little too late, and all this video harps on it that him canceling these flights probably lessened the spread of the virus.  Right now, this just feels so irrelevant to any of the challenges we all face.

The next part of the video is just clips of democrats complimenting his responsiveness/how he's helped them.  And the way Trump is acting, it's like he's done some grand thing.  No.  He's doing his job.  And a few, select thank you clips do not mean that you are doing your job well.  It does not mean you are above criticism.  It does not mean you don't have room to improve.

I guess the reason this video makes me sick is that it's so misleading.  It misses so much of the picture.  And if you stay to listen to him after the video, it just gets worse and worse.  It's propaganda, pure and simple.  I know people will watch it, believe it, and take it for the complete truth.  I know my dad would.  I love my dad, but if he sees it, all I'll be hearing about is how great Trump's response to this pandemic was.  It just makes me so sad.  Our highest government official can mislead us all he wants.  And this is something I've lived through.  I've watched the news, I've kept up with the spread, and now someone's trying to re-write the facts.  This is not okay.  I'm not okay with this.  And honestly, the worst part?  I don't feel like there's a single thing I can do about it.  Come November, my dad will still vote for Trump.  We'll still be dealing with this pandemic.  And Trump'll be patting himself on the back for doing diddly squat and proclaiming it's the best diddly squat this world has ever seen.

And the tax policy this time is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). Here's a write-up: https://taxfoundation.org/work-opportunity-tax-credit-wotc/ (TLDR: The WOTC essentially subsidizes firms to hire workers from a set of disadvantaged groups, including certain veterans, ex-felons, and SNAP recipients. Some evidence suggests that it has had positive short-term impacts on these workers, but it is unclear if there are positive long-term impacts. Moreover, it might have subsidized firms for hiring workers they would have hired anyways, and it also provides a tax advantage to high-turnover, labor-intensive firms).",

4/14/2020 0:00:00,"Ok so I don’t vote. It’s not because I’m making “a moral stand” as another confession claimed. I just don’t give a single flying fuck. I could not care less if I tried. Y’all are fighting over this utter BS and I DONT CARE. 

The only single opinion I MIGHT have is that we should prob have a Singapore-style system and give technocrats a lot more power (or just a Bryan Caplan-style democracy of the elites), and so I suppose you could argue that I should vote for candidates closer to that—and that would be true, if I cared enough. Which I don’t.

Oh, and in real life, I am reasonably politically aware (read the New Yorker, Economist, Atlantic, and of that white liberal nonsense) and if liberals/progressives ask me about mY tHoUgHts (spoiler: Idgaf) I tell them my excruciatingly insincere thoughts on how “Warren should’ve been the nominee and while I don’t love Bernie, I prefer him over Biden because of <insert latest fashionable woke complaint about Biden>. Oh, and isn’t it SUCH a shame that we can’t have a woman President??? Oh and haha i geek out sooooo much about carbon taxes and the EITC and you really should read some of Saez’s papers on wealth taxation!” — oh god I hate all of you for making me say this shit. imagine being the kind of person who says this SERIOUSLY oh my lord the cringe.

I cannot stress ENOUGH how LITTLE I care. If we got ride of FPTP and had ranked choice voting (which, needless to say, I often enthuse about when talking to the whole crowd) NO ONE would win because I would rank ALL of them negative infinity. Except for Lee Kuan Yew. That guy is sexy af. Singapore rocks (unless you’re gay or voice your opinions about politics).

Oh, and of course, when I talk to my buddies in the republican club, I start waxing philosophical about how Edmund Burke’s stupid-ass fucking abortion of a pamphlet iS tHe BeSt ThInG eVeR.

Yet at the same time, can we not criticize China for its coronavirus response? It seems like liberals are simply allergic to any criticism of China. Literally wet markets have caused a similar coronavirus outbreak before - with a virus that had a much higher death rate -  that we were luckily able to contain. Scientists have said that the cultural practice of eating exotic mammals in southern China are a breeding ground for coronavirus outbreaks. And look where we are now! China covered up the severity of the outbreak in its initial stages. Four months after the start of the outbreak, China is re-opening wet markets. Yes, China has co-operated with containing the outbreak too - but not until after covering it up initially. Are we not allowed to criticize the reckless practices that started the outbreak to begin with? Just because some racists are gonna get the wrong idea doesn't mean that we shouldn't avoid criticizing the Chinese government, just as we shouldn't avoid criticizing Trump's response either.",

Not to say I don’t feel grateful for classes. I feel so grateful that MIT is trying to keep a sense of normalcy through online classes and for the efforts on behalf of all the staff, faculty, etc. But right now it all feels so irrelevant. Why think about software if my dad might lose his job? Why think of heat equations if my grandmother is depressed because she hasn’t seen my uncle for over a month? Why think of big social issues when the neighbor next door needs groceries? 

And it doesn’t help that I still feel guilty if I don’t do my work (and in some classes, expectations are still high so you can tell the professors are disappointed if you don’t perform at level). The rest of the world is like, “If you’re bored, try this new work out thing!” but I am in fact—still hosed.

The friends at MIT can’t even go outside to Briggs field to get some air. We are once again facing the realities of our families and all the dynamics that come with it. Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

So point of this long confession being: idk how to deal with the fact that expectations are still high for classes, other than just accepting I can’t do everything, and that’s okay. But maybe a good place to start is to remind our MIT community to stop being the super perfectionists that we are for a little bit and reach out to each other to *speak* *about* *whats* *challenging*. Engage in empathy. Stop trying to pretend everything is fine. We can’t do that right now. let’s fucking scream into the void together and send memes, and hearts, and late night conversations.

4/14/2020 0:00:00,"Okay I know we don't want more confessions about Biden and Trump, but I swear this isn't an opinion but more me pouring out my conflicting thoughts and emotions, bare with me if you will.
I have been unhappy with most of Trump's administration's decisions. Details like reduction in environment protections, student debt forgiveness, reservation rights being taken away, just to name a few. Some stuff I don't care as much, some stuff I agree, yeah. But the way Trump insults people/concepts he disagrees with has been the most upsetting. When he attacks China, I can feel even more people trying to judge if I'm foreign or not.
I get the anger behind supporting Biden. I'll admit I was rooting for Warren. My preference in policy stances is more on the progressive end. Voting for a candidate that has been accused of sexual assault does make me uncomfortable.
The thing is, with today's climate around COVID-19 and the way Trump has been speaking about this whole shebang, I'm scared to be a woman AND an Asian American. Whereas with Biden, maybe I'll still be scared on being a woman, maybe I won't. But I'm hoping the racism would improve for all minorities, so I have one less axis of stress and anxiety. 
I know I'm showing my privilege and honestly I haven't had it in check as much as I should, since the fact being Asian American didn't invoke so much anxiety before. But I also feel like I live in a bubble where my close friends who aren't white or Asian are international or are mixed, and so their opinions are even more complicated. How do black and latinos feel?
The reason for this confession is that I saw an Asian American male acquaintance post he'll vote an empty ballot and I realized all the things I just typed out. And as much as it shouldn't, getting Trump for another term invokes enough of an emotional response from me that if voting for Biden guarantees he wouldn't get another term, I'll do it.

CHOMSKY: First of all, I’m usually fuming inside, so what you see on the outside isn’t necessarily what’s inside. But as far as questions, the only thing I ever get irritated about is elite intellectuals, the stuff they do I do find irritating. I shouldn’t. I should expect it. But I do find it irritating. But on the other hand, what you’re describing as inane questions usually strike me as perfectly honest questions. People have no reason to believe anything other than what they’re saying. If you think about where the questioner is coming from, what the person has been exposed to, that’s a very rational and intelligent question. It may sound inane from some other point of view, but it’s not at all inane from within the framework in which it’s being raised. It’s usually quite reasonable. So there’s nothing to be irritated about.

You may be sorry about the conditions in which the questions arise. The thing to do is to try to help them get out of their intellectual confinement, which is not just accidental, as I mentioned. There are huge efforts that do go into making people, to borrow Adam Smith’s phrase, “as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human being to be.” A lot of the educational system is designed for that, if you think about it, it’s designed for obedience and passivity. From childhood, a lot of it is designed to prevent people from being independent and creative. If you’re independent-minded in school, you’re probably going to get into trouble very early on. That’s not the trait that’s being preferred or cultivated. When people live through all this stuff, plus corporate propaganda, plus television, plus the press and the whole mass, the deluge of ideological distortion that goes on, they ask questions that from another point of view are completely reasonable….",

4/15/2020 0:00:00,"what are some of the signs of adhd for someone in the mit population?? for a while now I have been wondering if I may have undiagnosed adhd after my close friend from high school was diagnosed while in college earlier this year. we share a lot of the same work habits and other traits and whenever i call her to panic about how i've recently made things difficult for myself she encourages me to go talk to someone... 

i'm specifically curious as to how adhd can exhibit itself in people who go to mit and (likely) did well easily all through high school such that they may never have asked themselves if the way that they worked was the ""norm"", whatever that means. for me i'm just really tired of always finding myself behind because i've done somethin else until the last possible minute... and I generally like and am engaged by my classes and my work! not avoiding bc my major isn't a fit or something. but if i find myself wandering off and doing something else, like watching a show or reading something (news/book/wikipedia/fanfic/tumblr), i find it very very hard to stop doing that thing and marshal myself into focusing on the work at hand. ""oh i'll stop in 5"" turns into 5 hours later and then i'm a little fucked. i'm a consistent ""one minute before the deadline"" or partial pset submitter and it's not because i didn't have the time to do it slightly earlier, it's because i actively reduced the time i had by doing something else until it was too late. and this is a pattern that emerged in high school but bc things were easier and bc teachers liked me it usually worked out okay. i care about learning and about my work and i don't want to work like this and have this sloppiness be my brand... im just tired

this behavior has also affected my relationship with my family. i've kept family waiting downstairs in my dorm and made them feel like i didn't value their time literally because i didn't tear myself away from watching something that wasn't important or life-changing and i don't know why i did that. my logical side knows that doing xyz is important and that i care about it and want to do it but then i go off and don't do it anyway. 

i don't mean to armchair diagnose and i know that i really should talk to a therapist about it - i went to mit mental health once last year because i wanted to talk about my chronic procrastination habits but then um skipped my appointment a few weeks later because i was behind on homework bc i procrastinated.... i just want to know if this sounds similar to some of y'alls experiences. part of me feels like i'm trying to find something to blame my lack of willpower on. i should be able to do basic human tasks and maybe i'm just babying myself and being really lazy about it? idk. also, in general, what do therapists talk about in this realm? regardless of adhd, do they help you come up with strategies and help you figure out how to stick to something? and what does medication do?

he was the only one i felt like i could be honest to. i'm a really hard worker and normally in my friend groups i'm the one who's giving advice and helping others, so i felt embarrassed and ashamed and didn't want to tell my friends that i wasn't doing that well because they would just be shocked and that would make me feel worse. as MIT students we hold ourselves to such high standards and i kept getting rejected from everywhere i applied. i felt like i wasn't good enough to be at MIT or that i wasn't valuable because everyone else is doing such great things and i did my best but it wasn't enough. i'm okay now but he helped me realize that you really need to take time for yourself and not be so hard on yourself. if you wouldn't talk to a friend like that, don't talk like that to yourself. 

i'm really missing him a lot and i wish we could be quarantined together but i just wanted to spread some happiness and positivity. the right people will really make your day that much better. i used to not want to do anything at all but now i call him sometimes just to stare at him and we do nothing but it's amazing. i love you <3

And how much overreaction can be justified compared to the economic loss from the coronavirus response, including jobs, savings, entire businesses, and the mental health problems associated with economic downturn? What about the state and federal governments' use emergency powers? Does the virus justify losing the right to protest, gather peacefully, and move freely in some states? Are we as a society over reliant on the power of models and experts? Other questions: should the federal government be responsible for providing tests and medical supplies to the states, given the regulatory failures at the CDC and FDA, issues of directing supply, and differing state needs?

4/17/2020 0:00:00,"Genesis of a friendzone

The me who wants to get to know her more versus the me who wants to forget and move on.

I have had a number of crushes in my life.

One time, a girl was pushing her grandmother's cart through the supermarket aisles. Two-minute crush.
One other time at math camp, I bonded with a girl over puzzle hunt and card games. Two-week crush.

And then there are all those crushes that lasted for several years.

It goes like this.

First time I see them, I am left rather unimpressed. We coexist in whatever context forces us to interact indirectly. Then I notice something nice about them. Then something else. Then another thing. Quickly, I become obsessed. I start doing my research about them. I stalk them. I learn even more great things about them.

Then, I find excuses to get closer to them. I partake in activities I wouldn't join otherwise. I get out of my comfort zone. I learn. I grow.

I push myself to find similarities with them. I use every little bit of information to shape my mental image of them. And in between the datapoints, I beautify them as I connect the dots of their personality. That's it. Now they are ruling over my mind, from their proud pedestal. I think of them as I go to bed. I think of them as I wake up. I sing their name in my head. I dream of them, sometimes.

Is it even romantic? Sometimes. Am I in love? Probably not. Am I in love with the idea of being in love? Maybe. Or rather, receiving the attention of someone I admire. Of a woman I admire.

Is it even a crush if I don't want to date them?

How does it end? Well, after so many years being torn by those feelings, I can confidently say: the obsession passes with time, but the admiration can stay forever. In the worst case, the interaction becomes so one-sided that it just dies out. In the best case, we become good friends, exchanging news regularly, bouncing our thoughts off each other, reimagining the world together. And I value these friendships, built out of mutual appreciation and not from the necessity of a place or a time.

And yet, I know I have developed closed friendships with male friends without going through this crazy process. Even female friends. So why the fuss?

Whenever this happens and I'm in a committed relationship, it's even more awkward. And awkwardness is killing me. Talking to them is awkward, not talking to them is awkward. I've tried ignoring them forever. And that's how I turn weeks into months, and months into years.

Sometimes I wonder about what *they* have to go through, being on the receiving end of this. They did nothing wrong to deserve it. Worse, there is nothing they can do to stop it. And really, I don't know how I would react if this was happening to me.

I know some part of me wants to cut the chase. But part of me just enjoys the energy so much. I love the dopamine kick when her name appears in my notifications, when we can bond over common experiences or when we make each other laugh. I love the movies I am making in my head, I love pretending I am in one. It just makes me feel alive. And feeling alive is what keeps me alive.

So maybe let's keep pretending? Let's pretend I'm not thinking of you every hour of the day and the night? Let's pretend I haven't caught feelings for you? Let's pretend you haven't noticed it? Let's pretend none of this happened and let's go back to when we were just two people getting to know each other? 
Maybe let's pretend you never read this? And maybe let's be friends?",

4/17/2020 0:00:00,"I can’t believe I started arguing with people on the internet. It’s just that the logistics and politics and ethics of helping the poor during a pandemic are so weird, man. And while my small, inefficient donations hardly make a dent in this disaster, I somehow had the audacity to stay up till 2am arguing with someone on the internet over calling our homeless neighbors scum. I guess sometimes you fight the little things in an expression of frustration over all the big things you wish you could. 

That night I wanted so badly to scream. Unfortunately this isn’t really something you can casually do as a girl in the middle of the night in an urban area. So instead I threw my long winter coat on over my pajamas, slipped my bare feet into an old pair of tennis shoes, and slipped out of the house as fast as I could without sounding like a burglar.

I walked quickly, not sure where I was going, but filled with an urgency I didn’t know what else to do with. I felt on the verge of crying, but I didn’t quite have the sadness for it. There’s something about the stillness of the middle of the night in a city that reminds me of all those old tales about witching hours. The world was not dark (it never really does get dark in the city) and yet everything was so quiet and still.

After a while of looking down and thinking inward, I started to see more of the world again. And as I started to look up more, I was struck by a curious thing. It wasn’t just the streetlights that were glowing. It was also windows in houses. Actually a lot of windows were aglow for two thirty in the morning. As I looked around me, I saw a young woman walking through her kitchen. I imagined someone at a desk behind the glowing window sash above. Most windows were dark. But about one in every three houses had at least one light on. I almost laughed. I wasn’t the only one who couldn’t sleep. I wasn’t the only one kept up by stresses and frustration and fear. Maybe not everyone was kept up by the same feelings as me. But surely some were feeling just as angry and overwhelmed as I was. And in the midst of the pandemic and all my overflowing emotions and worries, somehow, looking at all those lit up windows, I felt just a little bit more okay.

2) The Tuesday of our last week, the 6.046 Staff was GRACIOUS enough to CANCEL OUR QUIZ. You know who didn't have that privilege? 6.042.

3) Our midterm was supposed to be 3 - 5 hours, but instead they GAVE US A WEEK. You know who didn't have that privilege? Students in 6.006 and 6.009 still had FUCKING TIMED QUIZZES.

4) Midterms are supposed to be hard, with previous years' average being around 40%. This time, the average was around 69%. ""Now I see why the average was so low"" smh

5) The Midterm was SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER than all the practice materials posted. The basic premise (i.e. what to modify) of each question was very clear.

6) It's FUCKING PE/IE/NE

It's really annoying when I see you online and you're not reading my message, like sure you're busy once but when I see it a dozen times in a row I start to feel insecure. At least let your buddies know what's going on, or schedule a time to call if you're busy now.

4/19/2020 0:00:00,"Re: privilege post
Due to the potential retributions of exposing myself (from one commenter: ""it's genuinely sad that it's coming from a member of our community""), I've decided to post this reply as a confession.

I am not the OP of that post, which definitely exaggerated things, but I do agree with the general sentiment that the OP brings up. I come from a traditionally disadvantaged background - I was the target of many racial jokes, and additionally had a racial stereotype to overcome when doing my studies. My family was relatively poor and unable to afford many things my friends did, and at MIT I still feel the disparity.

I don't blame my friends for their so-called privilege, nor blame my own lack of privilege for my own circumstances. Some of the people I know were born rich into a good family, and that's great for them. For me, I had to constantly fight the system when growing up. In the end, I wound up in MIT like many of my more well-off peers. It probably took me more effort than many of my peers, but I was able to put this effort in and overcome my own ""incompetence,"" as the OP said. I wouldn't say it is necessarily incompetence, but rather just my own living situation that was, in many (but not all!) aspects, subpar to those that my friends had. This gives me no excuse for my own shortcomings - I just had to work harder to get there. Sure, I grew up in shitty circumstances and had to face many problems into adulthood. But I was able to overcome my own shortcomings and reach and exceed the same standards as someone who didn't have those circumstances. 

Many of you would call someone who went to a high school like TJHSST privileged, or those who were born into a rich family and could buy their way into Harvard, and sure, you can label them with privilege. I agree. However, that doesn't give us any excuse to perform less well than them. I didn't have as strong of a footing in academics, does this mean I should've just kept my knowledge level there and not strived to improve it? Of course not. 

Let me offer an example - about ASEs. Those with 'privilege' may have learned all of the GIRs' content in high school and were able to ASE everything with ease. I didn't have such an opportunity. I didn't tell myself to just stop studying for them. Rather, I pushed myself to learn the material, many times without the help of teachers or friends. I didn't have good enough internet to watch the OCW videos higher than 240p, and I spent much longer without visualizations to grasp the content. I wasn't able to learn physics formally - my school didn't have that class. But at the end of the day, despite all these shortcomings, I was able to do as well, if not better, on the ASEs, even if it meant taking much longer. 

I would like to also offer an example from history - that of Frederick Douglass. He was born into slavery, and obviously didn't have the best conditions growing up. Did he look at the white people who spoke so eloquently, and say that life is unfair and he would never reach their level? Of course not. He instead saw them as an inspiration, and was able to practice himself, not even in 'good conditions' at all, to become one of the best orators of the time. 

Yes, he was 'incompetent' at speaking in the beginning, when he was a slave. He was still 'incompetent' when he escaped. He didn't wait for Lincoln to become president to become a great orator - he instead chose to fight the odds and do this himself, despite the conditions he was born in. 

And these examples also occur in pure academic disciplines - need I mention Srinivasa Ramanujan?

Things have certainly changed since those times. There may be more precedent for social change now, but this doesn't mean we should come and wait for something to change, when we could better ourselves instead of always comparing to those with privilege. The general principle of trying to better oneself, instead of blaming others for ""one's own incompetence,"" still applies. Just because we ""lack privilege"" doesn't mean that we can't do what other people have or are doing. The OP is right on this part - I cannot make the world bend over for me. And so I choose to bend myself; make myself better, and more ""competent.""

There is no exact aspect of everyone ""suffering"" because of these points. Some people are born in better circumstances, and it IS unfair. But that doesn't mean that we can't overcome our previous circumstances, to perform just as well, if not exceed, those with ""better"" circumstances. Suffering, after all, is universal at MIT :)

Thank you to those who read the post all the way. I hope this sheds some light on the points that I felt the previous OP was trying to make, without all the negativity displayed. I implore the commenters to get out of their echo chamber of social justice, and instead actually consider the ideas behind both the post and this one, rather than just resorting to insults (""The rest of your take is shit too."" ""i am not sure if u understand privilege"" etc.)

PS 1 - please don't judge other people based on their living conditions, even white people and rich people. Even though I'm neither of those, I do know that they also face their own unique set of challenges, that us minorities wouldn't understand. It is unfair to say that the challenges we face are greater than theirs, even if they may be more manifest. 

PS 2 - re: affirmative action. Some people, including me, definitely have had ""systemic oppression"" going against them. However, this does not mean that each individual is unable to overcome these oppressions. It may be a longer trek, a longer journey, but it is possible. I know - I did this. Affirmative action policies do not make sense. We should not change our own institutional standards to adjust for ""privilege;"" rather, we should uphold these standards. For us ""unprivileged"" people, I would rather MIT select those who were able to overcome adversity to be just as ""competent"" as those who were privileged, rather than lowering the bar for us. (It also makes people like me question whether I was truly worthy for MIT, but that's beside the point). Perhaps if we had an actual knowledge-based admission test as they do in Asia, our skills could be reaffirmed and evaluated objectively, instead of always hiding behind the veil of personality. These exams may still favor the privileged, but it provides a concrete method for us unprivileged folk to move up the social ladder. 

PS 3 - Please also don't dismiss this post as just ramblings from someone who had a less shitty situation than some other people. Everyone's situation is unique, and able to be overcome, even if it requires much more time than others.

4/19/2020 0:00:00,"An Statistical Argument for why Baptist Christians should murder babies (and be Pro-Choice):

TLDR; being a Baptist Christian and Pro-Life is a contradiction

Assumptions: 
    - all Baptists want to maximize the amount of people who go to heaven
    - if you accept the Baptist faith and you are sincere in your belief at the time of your acceptance of the faith, then you are “saved” and will go to Heaven, regardless of whatever acts you commit in life. This is what I was taught as a child.
    - it is statistically unlikely that a person will accept the Baptist Christian faith and thus go to Heaven. This is based off the bastion of internet truth, Wikipedia, which states that 29% of the world population is Christian.

I was raised Baptist Christian and am now an atheist and I came up with this funny argument whilst arguing with my still-very Baptist mother about Pro-Choice/Life. 

Baptist Christianity believes that there exists an “age of accountablility”,  which means that if a child dies before reaching this age of accountability, it will go to Heaven automatically because it does not have the mental faculties to understand right/wrong or Heaven/Hell. 

SO, if you are Baptist and you want to maximize the amount of people who go to Heaven, you should proactively be attempting to MURDER most babies, as most people who grow up do not accept the Baptist faith and are thus destined for Hell. Of course this implies that as a Baptist you should ABSOLUTELY be Pro-choice. 

But what about committing murder? That would be a sin. Correct. However, if you have already accepted the Baptist faith when you commit the murder, you have been forgiven of all sins in your past, present, and future, therefore even though you have indeed committed murder, you are absolved of it as far as the after-life is concerned. 

Therefore, in order to maximize the number of humans who go to heaven Baptist Christians should murder babies.

It's miles above paddling duck syndrome, where you're stressed, but you also have to appear composed around all your classmates who are also pretending to be fine. People suffer at literally every elite university; I might as well get friends out of it. 

I guess most of you don't really have trouble socializing, but for someone like me, I really wouldn't be able to make friends if we weren't all stressed and suffering in difficult classes. It's very hard for me to bond with people, even when we have similar interests (I'll try to say something about it and cultivate conversation, but then they'll brush me off...insight is welcome). It's only when people are stripped of their social walls that they'll actually listen to me and take me seriously. (Also, I don't think i'm that creepy--friends that I make in this manner do stick around. Clearly, I'm failing their resume review even though I would ace the onsites.) If I went to a ""happy"" school, I'd still be sad. The only difference is that I'd be the only sad person. 

Obviously, the ideal solution would be to reduce stress and to have better mental health services, but let's be real. No university,  especially elite colleges who have stablefuls of people foaming to get in, is going to try that hard to improve what have become costly and systematic problems. ",

Empathy? All y'all in the comments acting like I'm some monster for not being 100% for the incessant and over-the-top complaining. Y'all literally acting like the TAs of a class are conspiring against all of you because they're course 18. Because they dare to do their jobs.

The reasons PSETs aren't worth 99.9% of your grade is because in the end, while they are for learning, they do not demonstrate the ability to solve these problems. Exams are a better indicator of whether or not you can actually solve the problems, or whether you're being dragged to safety by your friends.

I had a life to lead, and that's exactly what I did: got a well-paying job in tech after finishing Course 6-3/18, finished writing a book, etc. Now that I'm in the bay area, so many more people are attracted to me. And I didn't even have to try. It's amazing. I'm not sure if it's just because I've gotten older and that dating dynamics change with age (maybe it gets easier for men later in life), but I don't think that's the case.

4/22/2020 0:00:00,"Just because you're quote-unquote masculine doesn't mean you're not emotionally intelligent. What I meant by masculine was not necessarily what our current society portrays masculinity as (which includes the stereotype of men being uncaring and cold, partly why I wrote what I did), but the general qualities as one of you suggested I mentioned instead. These qualities include physical strength, deep voice, high physical energy or the diametric opposite (i.e. laidback, unprovoking), little overanalysis (i.e. straightforwardness), good posture, bold colors worn on clothes such as black or red, involvement in sports (i.e. athletic), high confidence that does not verge on narcissism, ability to flirt, and height. These are all qualities I can think of at the moment. In any case, these are examples of the traits/signs I mean, and I do not mean a few of these qualities, I mean whether ALL of these traits/signs are seen as positive from your (that is, if you are a female) subjective standpoint. It is clear that from an objective standpoint, some qualities can lead to hubris, disrespect, or any other undesirable outcome even death. That's obvious. It is also a matter of whether a lack of these traits/signs (all of which I do not possess)--except I do have a fairly deep voice--matters.",

4/23/2020 0:00:00,"Controversial opinion coming up: 

I understand that there are many people who are in less fortunate circumstances due to the quarantine, but using that to attack others who are more well-off than them on social media doesn't make people more sympathetic to their cause. It just causes deeper divide, hatred, and misunderstanding between people of different social standings if one or either side is unwilling to communicate. 

For example, people bagging on the shared MIT pictures of at-home setups. It definitely wasn't the posters' intentions to brag about their setups or to misrepresent the MIT population, but instead they were trying to bring happiness and community to individuals in similar situations. Just because you aren't in a similar situation as them, doesn't mean that they were wrong to share their setups. Not everyone lives in exactly the same home situations as you. And to expect that every single post must relate to your individual circumstances is selfish in its own right. 

Yes, individuals with more privilege have to be more aware of their own social standings. But so do those in less privileged circumstances. Communication and understanding is a two-way street. Simply complaining online does not help anyone's situation, especially if you're turning an intended happy post and twisting that into a complaint about privilege.

At this point, no one can share their happy at-home lives without getting criticized. What do you want these people to do then? Share only struggling images so that you feel represented? Only post sad news so people can wallow together in their individual suffering?

This confession is not intended to trigger anyone, but it is a genuine question. I'm sorry to those who feel even more offended than they already were by the situation. However, I am genuinely curious as to what others think. Constructive criticism and civil responses are welcome.",

Yes, I understand that people are dying, and that in light of that, you feeling tired or struggling with a class or whatever is probably a small problem. I'm not trying to disagree with or minimize that. But feelings aren't necessarily logical. It's not like your mind goes, ""well, we're in the middle of a global pandemic, better shut off all my higher feelings."" In fact, your mind might even do the opposite, feeling stronger emotions than they would ordinarily. And it's natural and often healthy to express those feelings.

You are not alone. I didn't respond to your post for fear of recourse through politics or otherwise.  The only reason the psychopaths that abuse and manipulate graduate students can remain in power, is because most grad students don't have as much balls as you. 

Graduate student market dynamics are to blame - it is not an efficient labour market. There's often an information asymmetry. If people knew the truth about what working with a given authority would really entail, they would never sign up for it. If this was brought to light, graduate students would flock to those academics who do not inflict pain or unwarranted manipulation. They would lose the brightest and slowly be forced to change. After all, the success of MIT research weighs on the back of the graduate student.

Do not let anyone ever tell you that you need to suffer to grow. This is a common misconception (that you clearly have realized) among masochistic academics. You can voluntarily work 70 hrs per week, growing more and suffering less than someone who is manipulated into working 40. I applaud you for making the market more efficient and leaving. They do not deserve your intelligence, potential, and hard work. To those in power who are not toxic - please start holding your peers accountable for unnecessary suffering they cause.",

4/24/2020 0:00:00,"I honestly don't see why MIT would keep us off campus next fall (or at least offer an option for students to be on campus if desired). ALSO they should not be making a decision to open/close in May or June when it is WAY too early to make any knowledgeable predictions about the future. We have already seen how terrible the models have been so far (2 million deaths to 60,000...). And now we are realizing how many people had already been infected in January and February in Boston, so odds are some of us already had it (or brought it with us from GTL).

It would be so easy to isolate and protect the high risk individuals (which in this case is mostly professors). They can Zoom their lectures while we watch in class or we can just be super cautious when interacting with them and give them their space. For students who are high risk or concerned about getting sick, the Zoom lecture format allows them to still participate remotely. We are not going to force students to return, just offer the opportunity. We can also take measures to limit student travel upon arriving to campus, which would mitigate the risk of contracting covid from outside communities and bringing it back. I think that is a reasonable ask for students to return to campus.

I think most students would take the opportunity to return to campus. From what I've heard, most would try to take LOA if next semester/year is virtual. That would be devastating to MIT. As students, we recognize how the quality of our education has decreased drastically over the last month. MIT students are tough and are willing to sacrifice health (sleep, nutrition) for an outstanding education.

I just wish other people in my friend group would reach out or something. I mean, I know that Busy Beavers, Zeta Mu, and so many other spicy quarantine groups exist, but I'd really just like to spend time with people I already am close with; it's so scary to reach out to new people.

I can survive a minute in the pantry."" But then I remember her looks of disgust whenever I casually bring up anything even remotely queer to test the waters.

4/25/2020 0:00:00,"
I’m a 19-year-old girl and I feel guilty and ashamed for still being a virgin. I’ve never been in a relationship or hooked up with anyone. Other people have been interested, but it’s never been mutual. Part of it might be because I’m shy, or because I’m far from the most attractive girl on the planet, but I think it’s something more.

First, I’ve had body image issues for as long as I can remember. I remember looking in the mirror when I was like 5 and despairing that I was getting fat. As you can imagine, it only got worse as I got older. (Insert disordered eating stories here....) I don't like looking at or thinking about my body, and the thought of someone else doing that just scares me.

I’m also worried about the rest of my appearance. Between constant acne that resists treatment, and comments from my relatives, and so on, I've never been confident in how I look. It was only recently when my friends encouraged me to start dating that I realized I might not look like a hideous monster. And I’m still not 100% convinced. Basically, I feel all-around disgusted with myself.

And I don’t think not wanting to have sex comes from being asexual or demisexual or w/e either. In fact, people calling me those things kinda freak me out. I feel attraction, I fantasize, I can imagine how in the future sex might be desirable. I can't really explain it, but not wanting it doesn’t feel like an innate aspect of my personality.

I don’t want a label. I want to be reassured that I still have time, that my mental health will improve and I’ll be able to accept my body and I’ll find love and affection and pleasure in the future. I just want to believe that it will get better.
",
4/25/2020 0:00:00,"a while back I submitted two confessions describing my bad experience with X at MIT, and the next day, a confession went up complaining about people who complained about X. basically saying, X can't be catered to fit your individual whims, it's your own fault for not being suited for X. while I understood the sentiment behind the confession, my gut reaction was to feel angry and a little hurt.
first of all, I wasn't saying that X should be changed, I was just trying to express my own personal negative experience with X, and I even said explicitly several times that my personal experience shouldn't be taken as a blanket condemnation of X or a call to action. it also felt like they'd read the first two sentences of my confession and based all their confession on that, which didn't make that much sense.
then again it might not be related at all, they could be complaining about other people entirely, and I could be reading too much into things.
ever since then I've wanted to talk to the OP of that confession to try to work things out, but for obvious reasons that wasn't really an option. so :((",
4/25/2020 0:00:00,"hi 2376, i see you’ve fallen for one of the classic blunders, not too distant from the initiation of a land war in asia. 

the reason i use FBI crime statistics is not because i believe black people are more crime-prone or savage or malignant or detrimental to society or subhuman (i would go on, but you get my point - plus my idol Jordan B Peterson says to keep it concise) in any way, shape, or form. i use 13/50 for one reason - to stifle class solidarity via idpol squabbles. and it works (lol)

the noble white working peoples of america, to whom i lovingly refer as the “people of the land” or the “common clay of the new west” who already have that underlying prejudice we all know and love, are not going to read your Jimmy Neutron text wall memes produced by doc martins-wearing hormone-injecting close-cropped dyed-haired weird-turned-professional SH-reject Weimar degenerates and have their minds changed. (i can already see the pathetically Chinese-social-credit-analogue comments telling (((German Hello))) “wow this guy made you sound pretty badass” in an attempt to snag some of that clout coochie)

they will be presented with 13/50 and, as most are not particularly interested, take it at face value. your glasses-adjusting “well acktsually” will come off as holier-than-thou elitism that’ll go over their heads anyway (“i’ve decided that these statics are flawed because *factors like sampling bias that affect literally all static samplings* and that disproves the FBI, an institution with approval ratings higher than Obama’s”) - and that’s only if they actually see your stuff after interacting with the primary source material. 

i mean at least say it’s because of poverty or slavery or something, not because “the police are all wayciss because they aren’t staked out in 95% white neighborhoods to catch Karens exchanging kilos of Colombian at their weekly tupperware parties”

anyway,

it is in my interest as a straight white non-hispanic cisgendered neurotypical able-bodied 1%er TradCath male from East Campus to maintain racial division in this country for the purposes of entrenching the systems that put me above you and also for shits n’ gigs. that’s the only reason i do it. don’t take it personally (i also can’t be racist because i watch ebony porn and BLACKED hourly)

looking forward to seeing you all back on campus if the kung flu doesn’t cull you weaklings first.

I'm generally a leftist, and I absolutely can't stand the way that leftists here and many other places on the internet present their opinions and arguments... it feels as though they use sarcasm, confidence, and emojis as substitutes for evidence or precise statements.

Like, I agree that many of the problems that America faces right now are due to failures of capitalism (price gouging and general suffering of the poor due to insufficient/inefficient regulation of markets, difficulty in political organization due to overwhelming influence from a corporate media who is protecting their economic interests, etc). I accepted bernie as my preferred candidate as a compromise between my positions and the American overton window, and I had serious difficulty deciding about how to vote in the 2020 general when his campaign ended. 

Very rarely do any of these positions have factual or rhetorical backing as weak as presented by the internet left. This is normally an issue that reaches across the political spectrum, but it seems like it's getting worse on the left while mostly stagnating with libs, libertarians, centrists, etc. I don't know how it affects conservatives because, let's be honest, none of us actually read their bullshit opinions until it's close to elections.",

I guess I was hoping that you'd realise how much I liked and wanted you and maybe that you'd start feeling the same about me too. But you didn't, and I'm still not sure if it was because you couldn't or because you didn't want to. You always doubted that I liked you as much as I know I did, and I'm still not sure if that's a problem with me not expressing it in tangible ways or a problem with you not being able to accept that I liked you strongly because you didn't feel that way about me. Now you say that you wanna just be friends but that's not something I wanna do. That makes the feeling of losing whatever it was that we had all too real. I still think about you and I don't know what to do with that feeling. It makes me feel stupid for still wanting you especially when it's the case that you want me way less. You say I can't be yours but I also don't want you to be anybody else's. I know you feel the same way about that too. I keep thinking to myself that we met and became interested in each other at the worst possible time. I was willing to be part of something that you weren't willing to, I was ready to give a kind of love that you weren't ready to give or receive. I keep thinking that maybe if some circumstances were different that maybe what happened with us could've been different. But I don't know. None of this is in my control but that's just how life is. I was willing to wait for you, but you're not even thinking about me or the future in the same way at all, so I know it's pointless. You like me and normally that'd be enough, but not enough for you to even think about the idea of being with me and that makes me really sad. I want us to be able to just be what we are right now, where no future is promised for us but where we still had lots of fun. And who knows what could've happened? But it wouldn't be right for either us, I'd only be doing it in the hopes that one day it'd transform into a relationship, and you'd be doing it hoping to keep it from becoming a relationship, so maybe that's just us being dishonest with each other. You made my heart feel so full, you turned a bad day good, and a good day better. I would sometimes just get lost when I looked into your eyes. When I saw your smile, my heart would do a backflip. When you held me, I felt wanted and when you kissed me, it was ecstasy. We had this instant chemistry that I never knew I could have with someone but alas, that's not all that's necessary for this to be and maybe the stars just weren't aligned for us. Maybe it had to do with the fact that we first got involved on Friday the 13th, I dont know. Were you ever really mine at any point? Maybe not, but who cares? It felt like it, you definitely made me feel things that I missed the feeling of, you made feel things that I've never felt before, and you made me feel some things that I would never want to feel again. We've shared so many unique experiences in a short time. You are far and wide the person whom I've had the most fun with romantically. You turned my world upside down, you taught me so much about what to do and what not to do when it comes to relationships. It's honestly ridiculous the kind of impact you've had on me, but it has been a little under half a year. Maybe if you'd just remained my ""IAP love"" it'd have been less messy but that's on me. When I saw the signs I should've let you go, but I kept you beside me. I'm just so stubborn and stupidly optimistic. I like to think that we held each other back, but that at least we held each other close. I should've pretended that I was in the dark. I regret it cause my heart can't take this loss. I'd rather be so oblivious. I'd rather be with you. But I guess, as you said it had to end at some point anyway. Now that we ended, I feel kind of lost and sometimes feel like I can't breathe without the normalcy of having you be a part of my life. So maybe we can still be friends. I just don't think I'm ready for that right now. But I also am not ready for not having you in my life at all. I already miss the feeling of you being my little jetpack, my little cuddle buddy, my little koala. I've been staring at this for a long time wondering if I should submit it.

Perhaps some reassurance. Also a 19F Virgin. I hear you and, honestly, it was comforting to see another person who has been and continues to experience the same self-doubt. I have never been in a relationship or hooked up. Never had anyone mutually be interested in me either. I spent my high school years counting calories and skipping meals. Even then I failed to lose weight or get rid of the acne on my face.

I have resorted to demi- at times to explain my situation to my people, but I am still trying to parse through my sexuality while not being sexually active. I am told I have desirable traits by my friends and have been told to just try harder at getting in relationships. But really, trying and failing has just made me wanna give up hope.

So, I've learned to invest in other metrics to measure myself against other than some else's sexual desire for me. I am teaching myself that I can be a healthy, admired, and accomplished human being. Along the way, I have found different sorts of love and affection from people. Still, I have not given up on the fact that I could be in a relationship someday...

4/26/2020 0:00:00,"Response to the ""non-evolutionist"" confession:  I grew up creationist, and only learned about evolution from books my parents gave me arguing against it when I started questioning religion as a whole.  
Overall, whether evolution is a valid theory, whether we have an answer to ""what is the origin of life?"" matters little to me in theological debates. I am happy saying ""I don't know, but your answer is no better than my ignorance"" rather than engaging in an attempted scientific explanation for the universe.
Evolution by natural selection is quite obvious, especially with knowledge of DNA, and hardly requires evidence.  But to argue that this is the singular mechanism by which life arose from molecules requires a mountain of evidence,  which we do not have, which we in fact cannot really have with present technology,  given how most relevant data is erased by our planet.  The best hope for solid evidence probably lies in simulations/modeling.  So in short, I don't ""disbelieve"" evolution,  it's just something I consider a fact of life.",

It has been revealed that Tara Reade's mother called into Larry King Live on August 11, 1993, close to the time of the assault, asking how her daughter could come forward against a prominent senator.

 I have a small confession. 
Forgive this pouring of my heart. I cherish the streets of Boston, where we first met.

 The moment I clapped eyes on you, I knew you were going to be a alt-indie goddess. 
Recently, I have began to regard you as much more than just a tiktok star .

My feelings for you intensified when I saw you throwing it back in signu.

 I was further wowed by your tremendous dancing skills. You have hips like curvy bananas and I love how you handle those cute strawberry lips. You're so special with your Colombian ways, and the way you handle your dirty papa mango shows great humility and empathy.

 I know that to you I'm just a shy metalhead but I think we could be happy together, poking like two sexy glass animals.

 Please, say you'll be mine Kali Uchis!

My sisters always say it’s because I’m too sensitive, and while it may have started because I’m more sensitive than them, I think it’s also because they get criticized less than me.

Instead of judging someone and telling them they don’t have a right to be struggling with something because someone else probably has it worse, maybe try having some empathy and recognize that someone doesn’t have to have the worst possible life circumstances to still be struggling with something right now. If someone says they are struggling with something, attacking them is only likely to make them feel worse about their life than if you have some well reasoned advice or simply didn’t comment at all.

the way you worded your confession reminded me of a character in an excellent fanfiction i'd just reread, where many different people get together in a bar to chat and slowly become friends and reveal their differing moral perspectives, and it's a super interesting read! there's no judgement placed upon the choices that people make. maybe you'll relate to the character mentioned in the excerpt below:

Hermione frowned. “You care about the world, don’t you? And the future?”

“Not really, no.” Pansy leaned in. Her hair was done up in these loops beside her ears that twisted around toward the back, and Harry thought it was strange, that someone could care about their hair that much, but not about the world. “Look,” said Pansy. “I care about a very limited number of things. One of them is Draco Malfoy. Another is my brother. Another is Millicent Bulstrode. Other than that, mostly I care that I am well-dressed and well-fed and comfortable, and warm when I want to be warm, and cool when I would like to be cool, and that there is a breeze coming in from the parlour when I wish it, and that I only ever have to deal with Mother when I choose to.”

Regardless of the veracity of Reade's allegations, what matter most to the US are the big-picture policies that Biden would implement or veto, not the ways he treats individuals. While I agree that both these behaviors stem from a person's underlying ideology, I don't believe that Biden [thinks he] thinks less of women, and expect him not to act on sexist ideologies as a result. It appears that he also cares about his reputation, among all voters not just his constituents; this on its own is a form of accountability. I don't think voting for Biden will enable moral transgressions, though of course you're welcome to disagree with me on this.

But going back to the original question, is the statement ""I won't vote for a rapist"" really because people think it will enable moral transgressions in the future?

This is quite historic because I don’t think we have ever had such great options for president. These two gentlemen have great experience, a controlled temperament, and would be a great representation for this country. Furthermore, these candidates have an incredibly vast wealth of knowledge and I don’t think a single person would disagree that they are both among the greatest geniuses that this country has ever been blessed with. While Trump has Mike Pence, a balanced and true leader, Joe has only said his VP is a woman, which means he will also have the most qualified person for the job. Therefore, I agree that it will be very difficult to only vote for one of them for president. At least America can relax knowing that regardless of the outcome, we will have a top of the line President with 2400 on the SAT level comprehension, Mother Theresa level morals, Peter Schiff level economic analysis, Nobel prize level ingenuity, and Pulitzer Prize level communication skills.

“Historically, UA candidate platforms have been debated over The Tech. They are judged on their ability to demonstrate an understanding of issues facing students, often manifesting as their platform. The Tech hosts the UA Debate and their editorial board endorses a candidate. This year marks the first contested UA election in three years. It was both concerning and alarming to see The Tech Editorial Board not treat every campaign with the same respect.

Primarily, [The Tech Editorial Board] failed to mention that Danielle Geathers ’22 is the only candidate running, president or vice president, to serve a full-term as a UA officer, sit on a top-tiered Institute Committee, and/or chair an institutionalized UA committee.”

Throughout this campaign journey, many things have been said about us, our capabilities, and our experience. Many of these outlets failed to understand the depth and range of the work we have done here on campus. From reducing us to a ""diversity ticket"" to claiming our naiveté when it comes to administration, many have not given our campaign the same respect it deserves. Diversity is absolutely at the forefront of our campaign, as it should be, but ask yourself: if Danielle was any other race, would we be reduced to simply the ""diversity ticket""? I am absolutely proud of the fact that we value and prioritize diversity and for the potential for Danielle to become MIT's first black woman President, but the undertones of messaging like that is the kind of messaging that will allow people to claim that if we win, that we didn't deserve it and that we won simply based off diversity alone, messaging that has plagued conversation around affirmative action and messaging that is detrimental to our progress as MIT.

One of the biggest reason was that I social engineered my way into her phone and realized that she talks trash about me to friends and family members alike. Not once or twice, but everytime we have a disagreement about something. Been doing that throughout the time we've been together. Despite my attempts to have open communication, she still had a sort of fear of me to say things to my face, so she went to others. I was thinking of settling down with this person until I realized how two-faced she was. I did something unethical to find out the truth, and possibly averted a disastrous marriage. But I still feel bad. Has anyone else been in a similar position? How have you dealt with it?",

4/29/2020 0:00:00,"I thought that I was doing okay with the start of the pandemic. I have OCD and I was no longer the only one washing my hands every hour. People were wearing masks all the time and I finally had the excuse to avoid people. There was clorox, clorox, clorox everywhere. I didn't have to do intense laundry procedures because I didn't leave the home (I would have to do this intense hand and arm washing procedure before washing my clothes and if any of my laundry touched anything besides the inside of the washing and drying machines and the plastic bags I store my laundry in, I would have do my laundry all over again, even if a sock just barely touched the side of the laundry machine). I thought that for the first time in a while, I was happy because I was safer. 

However, I forgot that despite the OCD, MIT was also my safe haven. My mom was so judgmental of me in high school that I couldn't do anything right. She would fat shame me constantly even though I'm only 105 pounds. She would tell me that I look pregnant. I believed her because she was my only family. 

I guess that distance has been good for us because when I would come home from breaks, she would spoil me. Now that I've been home for an extended period, my mom is back to being judgmental. I forgot how much it hurt.",

Issue 2: Should The Tech editoral board have commented on this particular election due to potential biases? 
I also think that people are confusing two different articles: The Tech's official endorsement and the current President and VP's endorsement.

I'm curious how many confessions readers are voting in places where their choice is actually likely to affect the outcome of the election, or at least in ways that are likely to be felt by their respective political parties. For example, a vote for a 3rd party candidate in a swing state has very different connotations than the same choice made by a voter in California or Alabama.

4/30/2020 0:00:00,"TLDR: I wanna be a real life superhero. Probably impossible but MIT is surely the place to find people to help try right?

Like many of you, I find myself with an uncertain summer ahead. The end of this semester has been a bit of mess. I'm losing motivation daily and I'd scared that time will pass me by and my summer will be wasted before I know it. Even now, it's tough to face daily work. See, what I really lack since leaving campus, in this time of chaos and unpredictability, is a purpose. Education was supposed to delay answering that question, but not knowing when MIT will return, I find that I need to find something for myself before I slide too deep into that emptiness inside me. 

That's where an impossible childhood dream comes in. 

See, I love superheroes. Iron man was certainly part of my rationale for choosing MIT. I've consumed comics, movies, cartoons whatever I can for years, fantasizing since I was a boy that I can one day inspire the world by bringing superhero magic to life. I'm that kid who loudly proclaimed in high school that I'd be a real life iron man one day. The thing is I know I'm not capable of that. Not currently. Not alone. 

For me, I've kept this dream. Always thinking about it, always looking for ways to explore. I had lots of ideas, but ideas alone are worthless. I keep telling myself I need to learn more, but when is enough enough and I just stop and try. I'm a 6-9 major. I'm learning software, and intend to explore neural interfacing at some point to incorporate into a superhero design I have. But, I don't know hardware. I don't know law. There are so many daunting questions to address, so many impossible hurdles to overcome. 

But, isn't MIT the place to overcome the impossible?

If I don't make a move now, I don't know if I ever will. Am I prepared? Hell no. Will I be successful. 99% chance that I won't. Yet, I'll never know if I'll don't try and it's not exactly like I have something better to do this summer. 

If you're interested, I'd appreciate any help. The chances of completing alone for me are basically zero. With help, maybe I'll raise them to some epsilon near zero. I can't promise anything except wild dreams and ideas. Nothing will likely come of this. Yet, we're at MIT. Why not try?

Email me at reallifesuperheroes@mit.edu if you're interested. I likely won't start anything in seriousness until after finals, but I needed something to look forward to to power me through the rest of the semester. Hence, why I'm confessing this now. ",

1. Only rising seniors will be allowed back on campus at first. This is to guarantee adequate time to finish their graduation requirements. 

2. Course 6’s are allowed back, everyone else can go fuck themselves.

3. Any donors to Reif or the Media Lab will be allowed back under “essential work.”

4. All Greek Life will be allowed back for fall Marathon Monday only. They will then be prohibited from returning until January. 

5. Freshmen can arrive in August. All upperclassmen will return in November. Pretty self explanatory.",

5/1/2020 0:00:00,"If you think the mandatory WGS course is the only misguided idea from Fiona&Yara, you just haven't read the rest of the dangerous nonsense in their platform yet. Take their brilliant idea of ""360-degree review systems for faculty surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion"". While in theory this sounds somewhat reasonable, in practice such tools are often abused to impugn and malign heterodox thinkers. Enforcing the doctrine of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion™ is a sneaky Trojan horse for creating thought-conformity towards leftists orthodoxy. Gosh, how naive must one be to think that ""I'm a 20 year old radical activist who has come up with such a fantastic idea to advance my preferred social change"" while discarding centuries old tradition of Academic freedom. Signing DEI oaths is a horrible practice that has already infiltrated large parts of academic institutions, especially in humanities. As an institution, MIT's goal is to advance knowledge, not to elevate an extreme minority of political activists who have never had to think beyond the first order effects of their terrible policy suggestions. If MIT is to sustain its place as a world-leading scientific institution and a place for truly original thinkers, we must actively fight these authoritarian mandates from deeply misguided young student/admin activists.

While the Left is wasting your time and taxpayer dollars by trying to implement their BIG GOVERNMENT SOCIALIST agenda, President Trump has never stopped delivering on his promises to the American People:
Two of the world’s top terrorist leaders have been eliminated
The Wall is being FINISHED
A record number of conservative judges have been appointed to federal courts
America is respected on the World Stage again
The President knows the Do Nothing Democrats and the Fake News media won’t ever tell the facts about him and his Administration, and that’s why he wants to know what a few respected grassroots leaders, like YOU, think.

""MIT students want so much...but can't take the time to read UA platforms and practically vote on the quality of their next four years?""
All I can say is that if you really believe that the UA has any significant power over student lives and admin then you are severely disillusioned. The UA is just there to give us some semblance of representation, when in reality it's admin that makes all the fucking retarded decisions. You really think that any radical changes like the GIR proposal is going to get passed through admin?

There's a reason why ""so few MIT students vote in these elections"" and why ""seniors make a mockery of them."" These are not cause and effect, they're both symptoms of general student body disillusionment with the UA and admin.

Most of MIT doesn't vote because they know that the changes will be miniscule anyways, and they see both candidates as supporting a mission that they don't themselves care about or support. Voting implies legitimacy; non-voting implies discontent.

The UA candidates are so similar, but in typical American extravagance, we have two of them.

This is why turnout is already worse than that in American political elections. WE SIMPLY DONT CARE!

My name is Pranav Krishna, and I, a *fellow member* of this best class, am interested in becoming your class secretary.

I've been thinking about how to engineer the perfect last year for most of us, so we can all hopefully bounce back emotionally from this god awful pandemic and show the world just how resilient the Class of 2021 can be. Here are some ideas that I would propose:

1) A ""Welcome back to Campus"" gathering with sufficient alcohol to catch up on what you missed on during quarantine, especially for those who have strict parents

2) A Six Flags Trip (because every single fucking candidate proposes this)

3) An intricate puzzle hunt/Assassins combination game where you must either solve the puzzle first or defeat the other player to advance to the next round

4) Multiple Class Bake Sales and other Fundraisers to support our favorite Boston small businesses that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic.

5) Pushing for the current Senior Class Council, each year, to have input in the UA and give admin our sincere reflections.

While you may not agree with all my proposals, or think there are great ideas and avenues that I haven't explored, I'm definitely open to discussion! DM me if you have ideas to etch the class of 2021 into MIT history.",

5/3/2020 0:00:00,"I know this subject has already been talked to death, but here are several reasons a diversity GIR is not a good idea:

1) Many people end up resenting the subjects they're made to take as GIRs. Bio and chem are the best examples, since fewer MIT students consider then ""useful"" to their majors. Having a base in these subjects is valuable, and it's not too harmful if some portion of students harbor grumpiness towards biology. But similar resentment towards diversity/inclusion classes could become counterproductive. At the very least, students who don't want to be there will invest little in the course and therefore get nothing out of it. Worst case I think it could set up a very problematic attitude about the issue.

2) I don't think diversity and inclusion can be well taught in the classroom. If it can, it's certainly best suited for small classroom settings, but as a mandatory universal GIR, think how many small sections would need to be run each year. Thats a lot of staff for a huge new course and I'm not sure we even have a sufficient number of well trained people to teach it. This is something that's best learned by experience and exposure to new groups of people. More on that later.

3) We already have a lot of GIRs. I think they all have a place, but the number is pretty much maxed out. If you want to finish them your freshman year and stay track with one Hass per semester, you're already at 48 units. I understand the university has been changing grading policies to remove the pressure to finish GIRs freshman year, I think it should still be possible to do so. A 7th GIR would make this difficult, unless it's part of the 8 HASS requirement, in which case you're limiting student's HASS freedom (and since many don't wanna take HASS classes as it is, I don't want to limit their choices any further).

4) Classes are graded. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the idea of anyone being graded in diversity and inclusion. I think getting the grade would detract from the actual learning experience and introspection of the process.

5) There are good places for conversations about diversity in other places on campus, and we should better explore those. For example, bringing advocates into group GRA section activities, or into freshman advising groups. Some of the student groups already do worthwhile things (a very small example: I thought the ""ask a black person"" booth in lobby 10 was a great way to make cultural conversations and productive and not intimidating). I'm not an expert and would love to hear more brainstorming on this front :)",

The proposal to make a grievance-studies class a GIR is seriously misguided and very worrying. Unlike conventional HASS, these Critical Theory disciplines are steeped in an intentionally divisive ideology and can only tenuously be considered serious scholarship (https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-theory/). Please do not capitulate to the social justice ideologues by embracing an identity-driven outlook on the world. Let's focus on improving the effectiveness of our meritocracy instead of propagating the Critical Theory contagion that seeks to intensify racial & gender differences rather than reconcile them.

I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.

You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10.0%, or US$4 million of this amount.

However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.

If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.

Yours truly,

Truth is I’ve been actively using 3-4 different dating apps for a couple years now, but I’m still a virgin. I don’t even have my first kiss yet. I don’t think I have a problem with talking to women - I’ve been on dates, and multiple dates with a couple women (my hope being a relationship). We had tons of fun, but these women refused to cuddle, or even hold hands with me. They both wanted to take things slowly, which is fine, but things ended (in disaster) before we got anywhere physically. Because of this I eventually opened up to the idea of hookups - I figure beggars can’t be choosers, and maybe it will be easier. Still no success. I wish I could care less and stop thinking about it, but I have this constant, gnawing feeling that I’m missing out. Maybe it was getting sexiled by my roommate. The fact that I’ve been so close multiple times also makes it worse. All of this has been affecting my academics since I can’t focus on much else and I’m always feeling down on myself. I’m just a burden to my friends at this point. A close friend left me because I complain too much. I feel like I live in a completely different world than those who can experience physical intimacy.

I made the mistake of discounting them at first which was completely and utterly wrong of me for so many reasons. I hope they can forgive me.

Sadly, most of what I get in return is: “capital flow” .. blah, blah .. “comparative advantage” .. blah, blah .. “learn coding you racist piece of shit.” 😭 😭 😭 I’m just heartbroken by how much of the industry has been gutted, especially considering that those jobs would have been solid, middle-class jobs with income sufficient to raise a family.

This may be a naïve question from someone without formal training in economics, but why doesn’t the labor/populist Left join forces with the nationalist/populist Right to devise policy to encourage repatriation of American manufacturing?

5/5/2020 0:00:00,"Everyone immediately turns into an apologist when I bring this up, but here goes: the MIT administration has not gotten nearly enough flack for their backwards and lethargic responses to Covid-19 so far. Grad students, whose livelihood depends on continuing their work, have been left in the dark for months, hoping that maybe next week's town hall will shed some light two months after classes ended on campus. Meanwhile, every peer institution, including our neighbors at Harvard, have already committed to continuing research as soon as this summer. 
The plans for Fall are a blatant non-response attempt to cover all bases by an organization paralyzed by bureaucracy. For those of you out of the loop, the number of administrative positions at MIT has expanded dramatically in recent years. Essentially, this has enabled the top admins, upon whom the ultimate decision of our future relies, to browse Facebook all day in their posh offices while collecting massive salaries. They leave all the real work to be delegated to underpaid employees who can't even afford to live in Cambridge/Boston. 
So, color me surprised when they drag their feet endlessly while colleges across the nation, including the University of Washington, a massive institution in one of the hardest-hit regions by the pandemic, commit to having Fall semester on-campus. 
It is now clear what is really driving the decisions of those in power: the reputation and finances of the Institute. The administration is so far removed from the actual mission of MIT that they even ranked compassion for students below its financial standing in their released list of priorities.
The worst part about all of this is that they have the audacity to claim that their ultimate response will be based on science, something we all believe in. It will not. One condition touted as necessary for a normal Fall semester is widespread testing, something that will never be available in time for students' usual return to campus.
My only hope is that the administration will cave to the pressure of everything opening around them and change course to a normal Fall semester before it's too late. If they don't, well, I hope your glad you paid their bills with your tuition. Personally, I will be dropping out and beginning my career without a degree in that case. Don't settle for less; fight for more.",

5/6/2020 0:00:00,"Seeing all the protests against lockdowns make me a little angry - especially since it undermines the point of everyone else locking down in the first place and will only extend the time period when we really need regulations. Trying to channel this anger, I decided to try to hypothetically devise how I would try to address the situation as a leader of a community or country. I would like some thoughts on, well, this thought experiment. 

Firstly, I think the easiest way to balance different desires (at least on a fundamental ethical level) is allowing individual choice and consequence. Right now, the problem with ""covidiots"" is how they endanger others with their actions, particularly frontline healthcare workers and the healthcare system itself if they were to sick in large numbers. So, my solution would be to offer an ""opt-out"" lockdown. Government mandates the lockdown, but if you disagree, simply opt out, the key here however, would be that opting out would be linked with waiving rights to healthcare access if you catch corona. If you think it's just another ""flu"", alright go ahead, live your life like that and if you catch it and die... well you made that bed, so lie in it. Now on one level this may seem like a form of Darwinism, but really, I'd prefer to think of ethically along similar lines to euthanasia. I fail to see the problem to enable people to make choices that will result in their own deaths. 

Now, assuming that this idea is accepted, the real problem lies in logistical considerations. Firstly, databasing - how would one keep track of who waived their right and who didn't and allow for checking in an efficient manor. This is by far the biggest logistical hurdle, especially if this plan was employed on a national scale, and one which I'd like to get the MIT community's thoughts on. 

Secondly, enforcement. In my hypothetical, I imagine this being in the form of spot checks of everybody in public locations. If you are caught violating lockdown without having waived your right to public treatment, then an instant punishment should be levied. Personally, I'd argue for an extreme result here - prison time until the virus is contained. But I understand the opposition to this, so this point would be slightly more flexible. There are still problems however. In the prison case, you now potentially expose prisoner and guard populations to viral elements. Also you risk overburdening local prions. Even in the case of lesser punishments, who do you trust to conduct spot checks in an unbiased manner and report accurately? In an ideal world, this would be the police. Alas, realistically, I imagine things would be more difficult. 

One large population that this plan doesn't account for is the homeless, who may not be in public settings by choice. I do not have a solution that deals with them. However, I believe if I could solve homelessness that would be a much bigger deal in itself. Right now, they are risk if ""covidiots"" spread diseases more anyway, hence I don't this plan would significantly harm their situation and prospects much worse than the status quo. 

In regards, to convincing people to sign away their healthcare right, and remove any legal legs for suing, I think the angle should be government intervention into personal life - especially if this plan were applied in the US. All that one would need to do would be spin the forced treatments of covid patients as a violation of ""freedom"" and the government getting involved in how you deal with your body. I believe it's a fair assumption that the populaces that this angle would work on overlap quite nicely with the populace currently protesting. 

The final aspect to worry about is limiting the consequences of these people's actions to as few people as possible - the entire point of such a plan. One potential danger would be people who don't want to waive rights forcing into work due to economic incentives. This could include grocery store workers as an example who may have to make regular contact with ""covidiots"". The only real solution here is robust welfare schemes to alleviate economic pressure... an entire other debate in itself. The other at risk group would include family members of ""covidiots"", including perhaps dependents who would not have a choice where they stay. Unfortunately, I don't think the state really has much it can do with this group. 

So what do people think overall? Are there other logistical consideration I've missed? Or perhaps, do you have a solution in mind for one that I mentioned?  ",

I know this has been said before, but seriously, the biggest oppressor is physical beauty.

1)  Lookism is the last acceptable ism. People still feel comfortable making fun of and discriminating against ugly people.

2) Because of the Halo Effect, attractive people will have numerous more opportunities in their career than ugly people,

3) People will default treat more beautiful people better and bully ugly people. This follows them for life and has an effect on their self esteem. Look up the Pygmalion effect.

4) Ugly people are the only group that can’t have group solidarity. Women and minorities can band together and form groups to support each other, but not even ugly people don’t want to be identified with other ugly people.

5) People feel sympathy for other oppressed classes, but people feel disgust towards ugly people. Any ugly person who would dare suggest his or her physical appearance has an impact on their life would at best make the people around them feel uncomfortable, and at worst be told to “quit whining”. 

6) More attractive people are happier and higher earners.

7) Contrary to popular belief, a large component of beauty is OBJECTIVE. Think about the fact that some people are almost universally attractive, while others are unattractive. People who are attracted to traditionally unattractive features, such as being overweight, are the exception to the rule. 

8) There is no law or policy that could feasibly be enacted to better the lives of ugly people.

Physical attractiveness has a substantial effect on quality of life, relationships, and even earning potential. It is the biggest form of privilege or oppression. I’d be a beautiful, gay, black, poor woman before I’d be an ugly middle class white man.

Now I'm a year out of mit, doing software at a trading company, and desperately wishing I could think of a way to make that sort of impact and just doing it. However, nothing I see or think of feels right. When did I get so cynical?

I guess something that MIT does to you is it makes you focus on the big and important problems. When I was younger, I would have loved to one day give a TED talk or write a young adult novel since those things inspired me then, but now, I have this internal sense that making small progress on important causes like climate change or universal healthcare or avoiding the ai apocalypse matters more than making big change in a smaller sphere, so I don't even think of those things as interesting or worth doing. Even if I'm not working on trying to save the world, it feels like the next most ""noble"" thing is working on hard research-y topics to move knowledge forward, but I am pretty sure I wouldn't want to get a PhD in cs/math based on my mildly negative experiences with undergrad research.

Now, I'm so paralyzed trying to figure out what cause or issue is ""worth"" my time and worth everything I should have learned at an amazing place like MIT that I just write code to make markets more liquid and wish I was doing something that made 8 year old me proud, but also something that 23 year old me could muster enough enthusiasm to care about.

The ""School of Neither Engineering nor Science""  (S-ES, aka SnES)

This new 4-pillar structure allows for an unambiguous mapping of any department into one of the four schools.

What the focus should NOT be on is saying white people can't have any valid opinions on racial inequality unless they agree with 100% of things that minorities say, which unfortunately feels like how some of the debates go",

You got a lot of good advice, in your post. I'd like to note that you can also consider pursuing something non-technical. If your undergraduate research experience was unfulfilling, then maybe something in the humanities may be a better fit?

5/8/2020 0:00:00,"I know this is probably going to out me because there are only so many people this confession will apply to, but I need help from the greater MIT community. I'm going to sound crazy, but bare with me.
My obsession with finding people with the same last name as me probably really began when I was 10 years old. I was in Chinese school, and we were learning about last names,  that there were two kinds: single character last names and two character last names. We then had an exercise around the room where we had to state (in Chinese) what our last name was and what kind of last name. Kid after kid stated their last name and stated it was single character. I began to feel the teacher's gaze drilling on me and realized that this exercise was mandatory for me. I raised my hand, and stated I had a two character last name. For the rest of class, I could feel everyone glancing at me now and then. (To any future teachers, please NEVER DO THIS to your students, being outed as different as a kid and having it not be phrased as a positive thing is TERRIFYING.)
So, every time I've met someone with the same last name as me or also with a two character Chinese last name is a significant event to me. The first time I met someone with the same last name that I wasn't related to, I was 13 at math camp. I was 14 in APUSH when my classmate realized that I was Chinese and had a two character last name like him. We only then realized that we both had two character last names, after 6 months of sitting at the same table. My last year in high school and the summer, I met Victoria at Caltech after saying hi in the MIT Admissions group (if she sees this, lol hi Victoria, thanks for putting up with creepy me), and one of my campers that I RA'ed had the same last name and we took selfies to commemorate.
Now, one last thing, MIT community, is that in all of my twenty-ish years of my life, I STILL HAVE NOT met any male-identifying people with my last name that are not directly related to me. I know one exists-somehow I got their email because their kerberos had a close spelling to a mailing list I owned, but as an undergrad alum, is it really worth stalking down an innocent grad student? There's also an actor in Crazy Rich Asians that has the same last name, but they way he has modified it in his stage name, you wouldn't know. I really want to make this fact not longer a fact about me. Heck, I don't think my dad has met any men with the same last name that weren't part of our family.
So, just to see how crazy I am, how many of you have actually never met someone with the same last name as you of a certain gender that you're not related to? How many of you had thought about it before this confession? ",

5/8/2020 0:00:00,"To those of you taking 5.12 this semester, I wish you the best of luck! I took it last semester, and did reasonably well, so I wanted to share a few last minute tips

1) Synthesis -> For these problems, you need to visualize what comes from what. In general, while doing practice problems, I would highlight which part of the molecule comes from what product after everything has been done. See a functional group? Probably formed from something with a double bond. See extra methyl branches off an OH group? That use to be a carbonyl, probably, and you made it into an enolate and added some MeI.

2) Reactions -> Once you get the first step, it gets much better. Look at the reagants -> Acid? Start off with adding a H to an oxygen that's probably there somewhere. Base? Remove a weak hydrogen. Then, start looking at resonance structures and see where to proceed. Don't try wacky things like benzene nucleophilic attacks. There's a ring? Somehow the molecule attacks itself. Probably also that random oxygen's fault.

3) Atom personalities -> By far I found solace in thinking the atoms were kids, in a way. Hydrogen is everyone's bitch. Oxygen is one greedy motherfucker. No one cares about Carbon. By far the first hurdle I faced was figuring out Nitrogen isn't greedy like Oxygen (what I learned in normal chemistry), but has Carbon's back when it becomes a carbocation (lone pair stabilizes it). Carbocations? Everyone's annoyed by them.

4) Please don't be like me and wake up late the day of your final :)

a lot of AA advice seems to assume that you don't know how to plan things, or that you don't want to plan things, but that's really not the problem. what's the point of coordinating meetups (with good food + regular reminders), hunting down your advisor when he's ignoring everyone, or providing an open ear if your advisees just believe that you're not cool enough to pay attention to? (i'm not asking for a lot here, but like...if you said you were going to show up to an event, please let me know if you find out you can't make it.) 

the thing, i get it. maybe this is karma for when i was a freshman? i really do. but i don't think i was unjustified...i remember my very first meeting with my advising group, where i got to watch my advisor and AA make friends/get close with the other people in my group. that set the tone for the rest of my semester, and i declared sophomore standing asap. i ended up ignoring my AA and advisor after this eventful meeting, because it hurts a lot to try and get along with people who don't like you, and they couldn't give me any helpful advice. i actually remember how they tried to make me take GIRs I didn't need (and that I ended up ASEing out of), and i hated how they talked to me like i was an idiot who had no idea how majors, classes, or anything worked. 

and so i resolved to not force anything on my advisees. every batch, i get kids who know more in their prospective majors than juniors in their course. but maybe...to give unsolicited advice and force friendliness was the correct method? idk. ",

College application fees cost a lot for families that don’t qualify for fee waivers, so why not cap the number of fee waivers a student can use to say 10, so that every student has the ability to apply to a similar number of colleges and resources aren’t wasted?

I honestly think that things like this or people/media portraying financial aid awards as if they were equivalent to merit-based scholarships contribute to the class divide between the middle class and the poor. Middle class families often feel that they are being punished for their hard work and their children are excluded from scholarships and financial aid (and recognition), while their lower income peers are rewarded for being low income. Obviously there are problems with this view, but I do think there is some truth to it. If nothing else, a lot of people do feel this way, and arguments about systemic oppression and cyclical poverty don’t change their minds (trust me, I’ve tried).",
